# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem proof scout 2026-06-19T09-44-04-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-proof-011
- statement: Core and ProtoKits are latest-ref aligned and validation-green, including ProtoKits aggregate DSK proof, but Experiments remains 22 commits behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`, public browser proof still fails at module loading, and source-state hardening now constrains DSK promotion claims.
- why it matters: Promotion review must distinguish core/ProtoKits command proof from Experiments latest-ref proof, Experiments aggregate proof, browser-complete public proof, npm availability, and runtime hardening proof.

## Child Nodes
- id: ecosystem-proof-011-a
  parent: ecosystem-proof-011
  lesson: Core and ProtoKits still match the preflight-resolved latest release branch and pass available aggregate/targeted validation.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ProtoKits both resolved to `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`; core `npm test`, ProtoKits `npm run check`, and ProtoKits `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed.
  look further: Keep resolving latest release refs each run because sibling refs have drifted repeatedly.
- id: ecosystem-proof-011-b
  parent: ecosystem-proof-011
  lesson: ProtoKits aggregate proof recovered from the prior incomplete run, but Experiments aggregate proof remains separate.
  evidence: ProtoKits `npm run check` passed after checking 294 JavaScript modules, importing 236 ProtoKit indexes, and running its smoke chain; Experiments aggregate `check` still starts with `generate:flat-routes` and omits `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
  look further: Add the DSK smoke to an aggregate Experiments command, document it as required targeted evidence, or run aggregate validation in a disposable worktree.
- id: ecosystem-proof-011-c
  parent: ecosystem-proof-011
  lesson: Experiments available checkout targeted proof is green, but fetched latest-ref proof is still open.
  evidence: Experiments local `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f` and origin `6a4982ec59a06b5e0c7c12a56da58eed15866b0f` showed ahead/behind `0 22`; `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed only on the local available checkout.
  look further: Validate fetched `origin/0.0.2` in a disposable or fast-forwarded clean worktree.
- id: ecosystem-proof-011-d
  parent: ecosystem-proof-011
  lesson: Public DSK proof remains HTTP-visible but browser-stuck at `Booting...`.
  evidence: Curl returned 200 for the route; Playwright launch-state snapshot showed `Booting...`; console output showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.
  look further: Do not treat HTTP 200 on the route as browser-complete proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-011-e
  parent: ecosystem-proof-011
  lesson: The public proof import shape still targets sibling GitHub Pages paths that are not deployed.
  evidence: Local and fetched proof HTML map `nexusrealtime` to `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`; proof module imports sibling `NexusRealtime` and `NexusRealtime-ProtoKits` relative paths; direct curls returned 404 for those deployed URLs.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or a build-step import map.
- id: ecosystem-proof-011-f
  parent: ecosystem-proof-011
  lesson: Source-state hardening now belongs in DSK proof boundaries beyond first-wave install success.
  evidence: DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T09-25-20-0400` adds authored-source isolation, reset-source guarantees, retention-limit normalization, and initial terminal-state receipts; deep bug node `2026-06-19T08-56-02-0400` supplies source-level examples.
  look further: Keep runtime hardening fixtures separate from public route loading and distribution proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-011-g
  parent: ecosystem-proof-011
  lesson: Core/ProtoKits/Experiments ownership docs still point public proof work to Experiments and reusable implementation to ProtoKits, not core.
  evidence: `docs/how-to-protokit.md` and `docs/how-to-experiment.md` keep core as runtime/DSK/composer owner, ProtoKits as reusable implementation owner, and Experiments as playable/browser proof owner.
  look further: Fix proof routing/imports without moving route ownership into NexusRealtime core.
