# Domain And Kit Idea Expansion Packet: 2026-06-19T14-00-58-0400

- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-19-1301`.
- Latest current-lane packet added Traversal Proof Integrity Domain, navigation cost policy, navmesh identity policy, procedural signature taxonomy, recovery receipt/state consistency, and traversal proof rows.
- Latest ecosystem state packet says core remains aligned with latest release branch `0.0.2`, while ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments targeted fetched-ref proof, and public browser proof are still blocked by module-source resolution.
- Latest DSK architecture packet keeps traversal proof rows in the executable hardening handoff and preserves namespace, install transaction, and direct dependency policy blockers.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet keeps local checkout proof separate from fetched-ref, aggregate, targeted DSK, public browser, npm, and runtime-hardening proof.
- Latest deep bug packet adds runtime failure-boundary evidence: late DSK API-collision partial installs, reserved `apiName:"__proto__"` prototype mutation, direct non-`n:` dependency bypass, and failed-tick event replay.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, source snippets, preflight, and direct file inspection were treated as authority for this run.

- latest remote release branch: `0.0.2`

## Ideas added
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`
  - Runtime Failure Boundary Domain for DSK namespace safety, install rollback, dependency parity, scheduler failure lifetime, and proof rows.
- `docs/kits_ideas.md`
  - `dsk-namespace-policy-kit`
  - `dsk-install-rollback-kit`
  - `dsk-dependency-parity-kit`
  - `scheduler-failure-lifetime-kit`
  - `runtime-failure-boundary-proof-kit`
- `docs/described_examples.md`
  - Runtime Failure Boundary Harness joining namespace, install rollback, dependency policy, scheduler failure, and proof domains.

## Ideas deferred
- Direct source fixes for DSK namespace handling, install rollback, dependency enforcement, and scheduler failed-tick cleanup were deferred because this lane cannot edit source or tests.
- A second Composition Governance Domain was not added because the new evidence needs concrete runtime failure-boundary proof rows, not a broader governance restatement.
- A second `install-transaction-kit` was not added because the existing kit already owns install preflight and rollback reports; this pass adds narrower DSK rollback and namespace/dependency/scheduler rows.
- Public proof module-source strategy was deferred because it belongs to ecosystem/proof lanes, not this idea lane.
- Executable hardening fixtures were deferred because this lane is planning inventory only.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate `service-registry-kit`; `dsk-namespace-policy-kit` focuses on reserved keys, null-prototype policy, and own-property API assertions.
- Did not duplicate `install-transaction-kit`; `dsk-install-rollback-kit` narrows to DSK/runtime install mutation staging and retryability after failed late hooks.
- Did not duplicate `composition-audit-kit`; `dsk-dependency-parity-kit` focuses on direct install versus composer dependency policy.
- Did not duplicate `event-handoff-kit` or `event-idempotency-kit`; `scheduler-failure-lifetime-kit` focuses on thrown tick clock/event/journal semantics and failed-event replay.
- Did not duplicate `proof-coverage-matrix-kit`; `runtime-failure-boundary-proof-kit` narrows proof rows to DSK namespace, install rollback, dependency parity, and scheduler failure lifetime.

## DSK boundary notes
- Runtime failure boundary policies point at NexusRealtime core validation surfaces because they describe runtime/DSK/scheduler invariants, not reusable gameplay/domain kit implementation.
- ProtoKits should consume these guarantees once implemented; they should not paper over missing `engine.n`, install transaction, dependency, or scheduler semantics.
- Experiments should prove visible compositions separately from runtime failure-boundary hardening.
- Public route HTTP success, local green smoke tests, and available-checkout DSK proof must stay separate from runtime failure-boundary proof.

## Open questions
- Should `engine.n` reject reserved names, use a null-prototype object, or do both?
- Should failed installs roll back every mutation or preflight all mutating failure points before changing engine state?
- Should direct `engine.installKit()` enforce all `requires` tokens or explicitly remain less strict than composer install?
- Should failed ticks roll back clock/events, clear failed journals, or publish explicit failure diagnostics outside normal event surfaces?
- Should runtime failure-boundary proof live in core smoke tests, a dedicated hardening fixture set, or a ProtoKits-facing proof harness?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, or `.agent` files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route was fixed.
- No ProtoKits or Experiments fetched-ref validation was performed.
- No npm publication or deployment was performed.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
