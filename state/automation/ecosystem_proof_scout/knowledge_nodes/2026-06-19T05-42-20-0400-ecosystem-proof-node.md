# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem proof scout 2026-06-19T05-42-20-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-proof-007
- statement: Ecosystem proof is still local-targeted green and public-browser blocked, but fetched sibling release refs have advanced beyond the available local checkouts.
- why it matters: Promotion review now needs separate gates for core release alignment, sibling local checkout freshness, sibling latest-ref validation, targeted DSK proof, aggregate proof, raw file availability, public browser completion, and npm/package-version claims.

## Child Nodes
- id: ecosystem-proof-007-a
  parent: ecosystem-proof-007
  lesson: Core still matches latest release branch `origin/0.0.2`.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0` with ahead/behind `0 0`.
  look further: Re-run preflight before any public promotion or release review.
- id: ecosystem-proof-007-b
  parent: ecosystem-proof-007
  lesson: ProtoKits and Experiments local checkouts are behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`.
  evidence: ProtoKits local `8c1c933e5dc21cab0579dc3ae806341413f18b00` is behind `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8` by 22 commits; Experiments local `b4d48101ec599ae9ca2998734040874f377c8108` is behind `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f` by 33 commits.
  look further: Fast-forward or use a separate clean latest-ref validation surface before claiming latest sibling release validation.
- id: ecosystem-proof-007-c
  parent: ecosystem-proof-007
  lesson: Available-checkout local validations pass, including targeted DSK proof smokes.
  evidence: Core `npm test`, ProtoKits `npm run check`, ProtoKits `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs`, Experiments `npm run check`, and Experiments `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` exited 0.
  look further: Keep these as available-checkout evidence until sibling latest refs are validated.
- id: ecosystem-proof-007-d
  parent: ecosystem-proof-007
  lesson: The public proof route still stalls at `Booting...` for humans.
  evidence: Playwright snapshot for `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/` showed heading text plus `Booting...`, with console/request 404s for NexusRealtime and ProtoKits module paths.
  look further: Do not treat route HTTP 200 as a working browser proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-007-e
  parent: ecosystem-proof-007
  lesson: Fetched Experiments `origin/0.0.2` still points the DSK proof route at sibling GitHub Pages paths that are not deployed.
  evidence: `git show origin/0.0.2:experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/index.html` maps `nexusrealtime` to `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`; `src/proof.js` imports sibling `NexusRealtime` and `NexusRealtime-ProtoKits` paths; direct curl and Playwright returned 404 for those Pages module URLs.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or a build-step import map.
- id: ecosystem-proof-007-f
  parent: ecosystem-proof-007
  lesson: Fetched Experiments aggregate validation still omits the DSK first-wave smoke.
  evidence: `git show origin/0.0.2:package.json` adds flat-route, high-fidelity meadow, and fluid-water checks, but does not list `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`; the targeted command passed separately on the available checkout.
  look further: Add the DSK proof smoke to aggregate validation or document the targeted command as required evidence.
- id: ecosystem-proof-007-g
  parent: ecosystem-proof-007
  lesson: Fetched ProtoKits `origin/0.0.2` has expanded fluid/water/domain surfaces, but first-wave DSK ledger and aliases remain present.
  evidence: `git diff HEAD..origin/0.0.2` shows new fluid/water kits and domain-service exports; raw `docs/DSK-FIRST-WAVE-LEDGER.md` still lists seven first-wave promoted candidates, and `origin/0.0.2:protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js` still exports `createNCompletionLedgerKit`.
  look further: Build proof coverage rows for new fluid/water/domain surfaces only after latest-ref validation and first-wave public loading are resolved.

- This node does not claim the public DSK proof works; it records that HTTP-visible files still fail in the browser.
- This node does not claim latest sibling release refs were locally validated.
- This node does not claim Experiments aggregate validation currently covers DSK first-wave proof.
