# Ecosystem State Packet: 2026-06-19T17-10-00-0400

## Scope
- Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem State Packet
- Local timestamp: 2026-06-19T17-10-00-0400
- UTC timestamp: 2026-06-19T21:10:00Z
- Workspace: `/Users/crimsonwheeler/Documents/GitHub/NexusRealtime`
- Repos checked: core NexusRealtime, sibling NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, sibling NexusRealtime-Experiments

## Lane Goal
- Audit NexusRealtime ecosystem state, drift, and proof readiness across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, DSK promotion ledgers, branch targets, public links, and proof paths.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `ecosystem-root-018`.
- Latest ecosystem state node `2026-06-19T16-09-07-0400` said core was current and validation-green, while module-source strategy still blocked ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof, and public browser proof.
- Latest DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T16-23-39-0400` ordered hardening as base runtime failure-boundary fixtures first, lifecycle parity fixtures second, experience-edge fixtures third, and public module-source proof separately.
- Latest ecosystem proof node `2026-06-19T16-39-19-0400` kept local proof, latest-ref proof, aggregate proof, targeted DSK proof, browser-complete proof, npm availability, runtime hardening, lifecycle parity, and experience-edge proof as separate claims.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-19T16-54-05-0400` added query/command semantics rows: terminal LandmarkGuidance receipts, EnvironmentalAffordance query-versus-transition drift, missing activation state corruption, and RouteField live query mutation.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-19T17-01-13-0400` mapped those query/command rows into planning inventory.
- Prior packets and nodes were context only. Live checkout state, fetched refs, docs, tests, preflight, public URLs, and Playwright launch-state output are authority for this run.

## Agent Workspace State
- Used `agent-it` mentality and read `.agent/start-here.md`, `.agent/operating-model.md`, `.agent/automation-rules.md`, `.agent/report-format.md`, `.agent/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, `.agent/CHANGE_LOG.md`, and `memory.md`.
- Repo-level `AGENTS.md` file is absent; user-provided AGENTS instructions were treated as active turn instructions.
- Used Human View Orchestration for the public proof route. Mandatory question: Have I checked what the human would actually see, and do I need screenshots, visual inspection, launch-state inspection, or before/after comparison to validate this properly? Answer: yes, launch-state inspection is required because the public proof route is user-visible and prior state reported stuck boot.
- Used Playwright CLI for launch-state inspection. Snapshot showed heading text plus `Booting...`; the wrapper reported console errors, and direct request checks confirmed module-path 404s.
- Playwright scratch artifacts and disposable fetched-ref extraction directories were removed.
- No source, tests, public docs, package metadata, deployment files, `.agent`, or canonical repo memory files were edited by this lane.

## Latest Branch Preflight
- Command: `npm run automation:preflight`
- Result: pass
- Preflight timestamp: `2026-06-19T21:07:24.304Z`
- Latest remote release branch: `0.0.2`
- Compare target: `0.0.2`
- Current branch: `0.0.2`
- Branch status: `current-is-latest-release-branch`
- Remote branches observed by preflight: `0.0.1`, `0.0.2`, `main`

## Ecosystem Findings
- Core remains aligned with latest remote release branch `0.0.2`; `HEAD` equals `origin/0.0.2`.
- Core validation passed: `npm test` passed all 8 smoke tests.
- Required core GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links remain reachable.
- Optional npm registry metadata remains unavailable with HTTP 404, so npm-backed public consumption is still not proven.
- ProtoKits local available checkout is clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2` by 5 commits: local `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`, origin `06f5f3bd35e3b4c2c24d49d4affbe026b0d92c8f`.
- ProtoKits available-checkout validation passed:
  - `npm run check`
  - `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs`
- ProtoKits disposable fetched-ref validation still fails at the package-resolution gate: `npm run check` checked 296 JavaScript modules, then `smoke:imports` failed with 110 ProtoKit import failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`; targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` failed for missing `nexusrealtime`.
- ProtoKits first-wave DSK ledger remains public.
- Experiments local available checkout is clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2` by 24 commits: local `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f`, origin `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb`.
- Experiments targeted DSK validation passed on the available checkout: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref aggregate validation passed: `npm run check` generated 100 flat route wrappers in the disposable extraction and passed its aggregate smoke chain.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref targeted DSK validation failed: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` could not resolve `/private/tmp/NexusRealtime/src/index.js` from sibling-relative proof imports.
- Local and fetched Experiments aggregate scripts still omit `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- Local Experiments aggregate script includes `tests/fluid-water-lab-static-smoke.mjs`; fetched aggregate script includes `tests/tropical-island-scene-static-smoke.mjs`.
- Public DSK proof route is still HTTP-visible but not browser-ready: Playwright snapshot showed heading text plus `Booting...`, and direct request checks showed 404s for missing sibling GitHub Pages module paths.
- Local and fetched proof files still import sibling relative paths: import map `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, proof import `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, and ProtoKits imports under `../../../../NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/...`.
- Branch/version policy risk remains unchanged: release branch `0.0.2` serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.

## Domain And Kit Expansion Signals
- Current DSK core still exports `defineDomainServiceKit()`, `createDomainServiceToken()`, validation helpers, `createRealtimeGame()`, and runtime-kit primitives from `src/index.js`.
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md` and `docs/how-to-experiment.md` keep the ecosystem boundary explicit: core owns runtime/DSK/composer primitives, ProtoKits owns reusable implementation, and Experiments owns playable/browser proof.
- Neighboring architecture/proof nodes keep runtime hardening, lifecycle parity, experience-edge proof, public browser proof, fetched-ref proof, aggregate proof, npm metadata, and package-version policy separate.
- New neighboring deep bug and idea lanes add query/command semantics rows: terminal receipts, side-effect-free query policy, rejected-command state preservation, and query snapshot isolation.
- The user/reviewer-facing ecosystem blocker did not move: module-source strategy remains the cross-repo proof gate, while runtime failure-boundary, lifecycle parity, experience-edge, and query/command semantics rows are separate hardening gates.

## Evidence
- `npm run automation:preflight` passed and resolved latest branch `0.0.2`.
- Core `git status --short --branch` showed `## 0.0.2...origin/0.0.2` plus pre-existing automation/doc dirt.
- Core `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2` showed `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0` for both.
- Core `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2` showed `0 0`.
- Core `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
- ProtoKits `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`, and ahead/behind checks showed a clean local checkout behind origin by 5 commits.
- ProtoKits `npm run check` passed after checking 294 JavaScript modules, importing 236 ProtoKit indexes, and running its local smoke chain.
- ProtoKits `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed.
- ProtoKits disposable extracted `origin/0.0.2` at `06f5f3bd35e3b4c2c24d49d4affbe026b0d92c8f` failed `npm run check` and targeted DSK smoke because `nexusrealtime` was not resolvable.
- Experiments `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`, and ahead/behind checks showed a clean local checkout behind origin by 24 commits.
- Experiments local `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed.
- Experiments disposable extracted `origin/0.0.2` at `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb` passed `npm run check` and failed targeted DSK smoke on missing sibling `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
- Direct curl/fetch checks confirmed required proof raw files and ProtoKits ledger are public, while runtime dependency paths used by the public page are 404.
- Playwright opened the public DSK proof route; snapshot showed `DSK first-wave proof` content plus `Booting...`; wrapper reported console errors and direct request checks confirmed dependency-path 404s.
- Temporary Playwright artifacts and disposable extracted validation folders were removed after inspection.

## Suggested Canonical Updates
- Define one module-source strategy for proof and release validation: package/workspace dependency, CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or build-step import map.
- Validate ProtoKits fetched `origin/0.0.2` with the chosen `nexusrealtime` package-resolution model before claiming latest-ref ProtoKits proof.
- Validate Experiments fetched `origin/0.0.2` targeted DSK smoke with the same module-source model used by public proof.
- Wire `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` into aggregate Experiments validation or document it as required targeted evidence.
- Keep disposable validation for write-producing Experiments aggregate checks until route generation is idempotent in the main checkout.
- Update public consumption wording or release policy so docs distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch consumption from unavailable npm registry metadata.
- Decide whether branch `0.0.2` serving package version `0.1.0` is intentional policy or stale release metadata.
- Route runtime failure-boundary, lifecycle parity, experience-edge, and query/command semantics rows into executable hardening fixtures, not public module-loading claims.

## Knowledge Nodes
- Wrote `state/automation/ecosystem_state_scout/knowledge_nodes/2026-06-19T17-10-00-0400-ecosystem-state-node.md`.
- New root lesson: Core remains current and validation-green, but ecosystem proof readiness is unchanged: module-source strategy still blocks ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof, and public browser proof; new query/command semantics rows are real hardening inventory but separate from distribution proof.

## Master Tracker Updates
- Added `ecosystem-root-019`.
- Marked `ecosystem-root-018` as superseded by `ecosystem-root-019`.
- Added child branches for core currentness, module-source strategy, ProtoKits package resolution, Experiments targeted fetched-ref proof, public proof import shape, aggregate DSK proof validation, generated-route validation boundary, query/command semantics hardening, npm gap, and package-version policy.
