# DSK Architecture State Packet

## Timestamp
- 2026-06-19T07-24-53-0400

## Lane Goal
- Audit DSK architecture, contracts, invariants, scaling, and promotion risk for long-term NexusRealtime production viability.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `dsk-spatial-mobility-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0624`.
- Latest DSK packet `2026-06-19T06-24-24-0400` says current `origin/0.0.2` remains release-aligned and test-green, but DSK promotion fixtures must include spatial/mobility invariant gates alongside namespace, install, dependency, state-contract, service-call, and operations-data gates.
- Latest ecosystem state packet `2026-06-19T07-11-00-0400` updates sibling context: core, ProtoKits, and Experiments are clean/aligned on latest release refs and validation-green, but public browser proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy, and DSK hardening gates remain open.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet `2026-06-19T06-46-32-0400` keeps local targeted proof green but public browser proof blocked at `Booting...`; sibling drift in that packet was superseded by the newer ecosystem state packet.
- Latest deep bug packet `2026-06-19T06-53-41-0400` adds receipt identity, event idempotency, claim idempotency, and request generated-id gaps.
- Latest domain idea packet `2026-06-19T07-01-13-0400` converts those receipt bugs into planning inventory for receipt identity, event idempotency, claim receipt policy, request identity, and proof rows.
- These packets are context only. Live source, tests, docs, focused probes, git state, and preflight are authority for this run.

  - Result before this packet: no source/test diff; tracked diffs in planning docs and the DSK master tracker from prior automation state.
- `npm test`
  - Result: pass, 8 smoke tests.
- Focused `node --input-type=module` DSK probe
  - Result: confirmed reserved namespace behavior, non-atomic API collision install, and direct missing non-`n:` dependency install.
- Focused `node --input-type=module` receipt probe
  - Result: confirmed TimingWindow result id overwrite, repeated InteractionTarget completion events, duplicate Collectible claim events, and RequestFulfillment generated id collision.
- One discarded receipt probe attempt
  - Result: failed because the probe read event-surface journal records as direct payloads; corrected by reading `record.payload`.
- `rg -n "Domain Service|domain-service|n:<|engine\\.n|asyncReady|ProtoKit|runtime-kit|defineDomainServiceKit|Receipt Integrity|receipt identity|event idempotency|request identity|Spatial Mobility|transition-state|immediate-threshold|hazard identity|resource-bound" README.md docs/described_examples.md docs/domain_ideas.md docs/kits_ideas.md docs/how-to-protokit.md`
  - Result: docs still describe DSK as the promoted contract, ProtoKits as the default implementation target, and spatial/mobility plus receipt-integrity inventory as planning material.

## DSK contract state
- `defineRuntimeKit()` remains the low-level installable primitive for ECS definitions, systems, bindings, registries, sequences, sequence nodes, metadata, and install hooks.
- `defineDomainServiceKit()` wraps runtime kits with required `domain`, `stability`, `version`, default stable id `n-<domain>-kit`, default `n:<domain>` provide token, optional service tokens, DSK metadata, and an `engine.n.<apiName>` bridge.
- `createDomainServiceToken()` normalizes domain/service names into `n:` capability tokens.
- `src/index.js` exports the DSK surface plus the timing, interaction, collectible, request, spatial, time, hazard, and mobility kits relevant to current promotion fixture planning.
- DSK execution remains normal runtime-kit install plus linear scheduler phases. `asyncReady`, `snapshot`, `reset`, and `serializableState` remain metadata/convention, not enforced runtime boundaries.
- `createGameKitComposer()` enforces all declared `requires` tokens during composition. Direct `installRuntimeKit()` only rejects missing DSK requirements whose tokens start with `n:`.
- No live source drift was found that resolves prior DSK blockers on current `origin/0.0.2`.

## Invariant coverage
- Covered by current smoke/freeze tests:
  - default `n-<domain>-kit` id
  - default `n:<domain>` and service tokens
  - metadata kind, namespace, linear execution, and async-ready default
  - invalid domain/provides/version errors
  - extension duplicate resource/system checks
  - missing `n:` dependency rejection on direct engine install
  - normal `engine.n.<api>` install path
  - simple JSON-serializable snapshot happy path
  - same-object duplicate install no-op
  - same-id duplicate DSK rejection
  - normal API collision throws
  - public export presence
- Still not covered:
  - reserved `apiName` keys and own-property namespace guarantees
  - rollback after any failed install stage
  - direct install behavior for missing non-`n:` requirements
  - duplicate provider-token diagnostics across different DSK ids
  - path ownership and private-resource coupling between domains
  - reset/snapshot absence, failure, non-serializable state, and restore policy
  - async metadata override behavior and async boundary expectations
  - accepted/rejected service-call receipts before side effects
  - one-shot completion events and reset-safe completion state
  - large-delta catch-up and leftover progress policy
  - finite numeric config normalization before simulation state is created
  - immutable authored config versus runtime state fields
  - stable generated identity across authored/restored/manual entities
  - finite ledger mutation gates
  - initial/restored aggregate-state consistency
  - spatial nearest/query state versus entered/exited transition state
  - zero-duration and zero-threshold settlement policy
  - generated hazard identity across authored/restored/spawned data
  - resource-bound normalization before mobility simulation uses capacity state
  - stable result receipt ids separate from query/window ids
  - transition-only interaction completion events
  - duplicate claim policy matching stored-state idempotency
  - generated request identity across authored, restored, and manual data

## Domain and kit expansion architecture notes
- Expansion docs remain planning inventory, not public release contract.
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md` keeps new reusable kit implementations in ProtoKits by default; core should receive only runtime contracts, validation invariants, composer rules, ECS/scheduler primitives, or DSK hardening.
- `docs/domain_ideas.md` now includes both Spatial Mobility Invariant Domain and Receipt Integrity Domain.
- `docs/kits_ideas.md` now includes transition-state, immediate-threshold, hazard-identity, resource-bound-normalization, receipt-identity, event-idempotency, claim-receipt-policy, request-identity-policy, and proof kit candidates, all pointed at ProtoKits.
- `docs/described_examples.md` now includes Spatial Mobility Invariant Harness and Receipt Integrity Harness examples.
- This does not change the core contract. It raises the fixture bar for DSK promotion because event receipts can be corrupt or repeated even when state mutation and install mechanics appear green.
- Ecosystem state now says sibling latest-ref validation is green for this run, but public browser proof, aggregate DSK smoke wiring, npm metadata, package-version policy, and runtime hardening remain separate gates.

## Scaling risks
- `installRuntimeKit()` rebuilds installed provides from `engine.kits.flatMap(...)` for each DSK install. This is acceptable at smoke scale but weak for larger provider graphs.
- `createGameKitComposer()` repeatedly scans pending kits until dependencies resolve, trending quadratically with larger kit counts.
- `engine.n` is a flat normal object, so broad DSK promotion increases collision, inherited-key, reserved-key, discoverability, and ownership risks.
- Direct-install dependency behavior differs from composer behavior, which can produce different outcomes for the same kit graph depending on entry path.
- Metadata-only reset/snapshot/async claims are insufficient for replay, restore, network, worker, or long-lived engine promotion.
- Domain service APIs can be structurally valid while still violating transition-state, immediate-threshold, stable-identity, resource-bound, accepted-mutation, idempotency, time-step, config-normalization, immutable-config, finite-ledger, restored-state, receipt-identity, event-idempotency, claim-policy, or request-identity policy.

## Bug candidates
- Confirmed: reserved namespace API key. Probe result for `apiName:"__proto__"`: `own:false`, `keys:[]`, `protoMarker:"__proto__-api"`, and `valueMarker:"__proto__-api"`.
- Confirmed: failed API collision install is non-atomic. Probe result after collision: thrown error plus `engine.kits` and `engine.domainServiceKits` both contain `n-late-collision-kit`.
- Confirmed/design gap: direct DSK install allows a missing non-`n:` requirement. Probe result: `n-generic-dependent-kit` installs with `requires:["runtime:needed"]` and no provider.
- Confirmed: TimingWindowKit overwrites action/result receipt id with active window id. Probe result: result id `strike`, window id `strike`, event id `strike` for an action without an explicit id.
- Confirmed: InteractionTargetKit repeats completion events for already-complete explicit targets. Probe result: completion batches `[["switch-a"], ["switch-a"]]`.
- Confirmed: CollectibleKit emits duplicate claim events while stored state stays idempotent. Probe result: claim batches `[["coin-a"], ["coin-a"]]`, collected state `["coin-a"]`.
- Confirmed: RequestFulfillmentKit can generate duplicate request ids. Probe result: created id `request-2`, request ids `["request-2", "request-2"]`.
- Still relevant from previous DSK packet: SpatialScale outside-nearest to inside can miss entry receipts, ScenarioDuration zero-duration state can remain inert, HazardField can duplicate generated ids, and VehicleDynamics can grant zero-capacity boost.
- Candidate: The DSK promotion fixture plan should now include receipt-integrity rows in addition to spatial/mobility, operations data, service-call, state-contract, dependency, install, and namespace rows.

## Missing tests
- Reserved `apiName` handling for `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`.
- Own-property assertions for every installed `engine.n` API.
- Failed install rollback after API collision, `initWorld` throw, registry throw, scheduler add throw, sequence runtime throw, sequence node runtime throw, and install hook throw.
- Direct install parity or documented divergence for non-`n:` `requires` tokens.
- Duplicate provider-token diagnostics across different DSK ids.
- End-to-end `extendDomainServiceKit()` install behavior, not only definition-time duplicate checks.
- Reset/snapshot absence, failure, non-serializable state, and restore/reset policy coverage.
- Async metadata override tests that explicitly state async is metadata-only today.
- Promotion fixture for objective reset and completion-event idempotency.
- Promotion fixture for lifecycle/economy accepted-state side effects.
- Promotion fixture for transport large-delta catch-up.
- Promotion fixture for schedule/config finite numeric normalization.
- Promotion fixture for occupant reset/id uniqueness.
- Promotion fixture for facility/economy finite transaction rejection or normalization.
- Promotion fixture for resource-pressure initial/restored depletion consistency.
- Promotion fixture for spatial outside-nearest to inside entry receipts.
- Promotion fixture for zero-duration and zero-time checkpoint settlement.
- Promotion fixture for hazard generated id uniqueness.
- Promotion fixture for zero-capacity and over-capacity mobility resource normalization.
- Promotion fixture for TimingWindow result id versus window id separation.
- Promotion fixture for InteractionTarget transition-only completion events.
- Promotion fixture for Collectible duplicate direct and objective-completion claim behavior.
- Promotion fixture for RequestFulfillment generated id uniqueness with authored/restored ids.

## Promotion risks
- Do not promote broad ProtoKit or domain idea graphs into core until namespace safety, install atomicity, dependency policy, state contract enforcement, service-call policy, operations data integrity, spatial/mobility invariants, and receipt integrity have executable fixtures.
- Do not claim async DSK execution, worker readiness, network partitioning, or replay/restore support from current metadata.
- Do not claim npm package availability; optional npm metadata remains 404.
- Do not treat public route HTTP 200 as a working DSK browser proof; neighboring lanes still show `Booting...` with missing module paths.
- Do not treat Experiments aggregate validation as DSK first-wave proof coverage unless the targeted DSK smoke is included or explicitly documented.
- Do not treat idea docs as canonical public architecture.
- Do not treat passing smoke tests as proof for transition receipts, immediate thresholds, stable generated ids, resource-bound normalization, accepted mutation, completion idempotency, time catch-up, config normalization, recovery, transfer, restored progress, input semantics, immutable config, finite transactions, restored-state consistency, receipt identity, event idempotency, claim policy, or request identity.

## Suggested next review item
- Use a non-scout lane to write the smallest DSK promotion hardening fixture plan, then implement the first executable fixture set:
  - `engine.n` namespace policy
  - install preflight/rollback transaction boundaries
  - direct-install dependency parity versus composer-only policy
  - minimal reset/snapshot/serialization contract
  - service-call gates for accepted mutation, completion idempotency, time catch-up, and config normalization
  - operations data gates for immutable config, stable ids, finite transactions, and restored-state consistency
  - spatial/mobility gates for transition receipts, immediate thresholds, hazard identity, and resource-bound normalization
  - receipt-integrity gates for result id separation, transition-only events, claim policy, and request id allocation

## Not claimed
- No bugs were fixed.
- No source, tests, docs, examples, package metadata, repo memory, public claims, `.agent` files, ProtoKits, Experiments, deployments, pulls, merges, or resets were edited/performed.
- Passing `npm test` does not prove production DSK readiness.
- This packet does not prove browser UX, public proof completion, npm publication, aggregate DSK proof coverage, async execution, worker/network readiness, or broad domain graph promotion.
