# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem proof scout 2026-06-19T07-42-18-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-proof-009
- statement: Ecosystem proof is latest-ref green locally across core, ProtoKits, and Experiments, but public-browser proof still fails at module loading and DSK proof coverage remains split between targeted, aggregate, distribution, and hardening gates.
- why it matters: Promotion review can drop sibling-behind as the active blocker for this run, but it still cannot claim public proof success, npm installability, aggregate DSK coverage, or production-ready DSK invariants.

## Child Nodes
- id: ecosystem-proof-009-a
  parent: ecosystem-proof-009
  lesson: Core, ProtoKits, and Experiments all match fetched latest release branch `origin/0.0.2`.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ProtoKits both resolved to `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`; Experiments both resolved to `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f`; all ahead/behind counts were `0 0`.
  look further: Keep sibling branch alignment as a recurring watch because prior runs saw drift.
- id: ecosystem-proof-009-b
  parent: ecosystem-proof-009
  lesson: Local latest-ref validations pass, including targeted DSK proof smokes.
  evidence: Core `npm test`, ProtoKits `npm run check`, ProtoKits `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs`, Experiments `npm run check`, and Experiments `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` all exited 0.
  look further: Keep targeted DSK proof distinct from aggregate check proof until the smoke is wired or documented.
- id: ecosystem-proof-009-c
  parent: ecosystem-proof-009
  lesson: Public DSK proof remains human-visible stuck at `Booting...`.
  evidence: Playwright opened `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/`; body text and `#proof-status` remained `Booting...`; console/request evidence showed 404s for sibling NexusRealtime and ProtoKits module paths.
  look further: Do not treat HTTP 200 on the route as browser-complete proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-009-d
  parent: ecosystem-proof-009
  lesson: The public proof import shape still targets sibling GitHub Pages paths that are not deployed.
  evidence: Fetched `origin/0.0.2` proof HTML maps `nexusrealtime` to `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`; `src/proof.js` imports sibling `NexusRealtime` and `NexusRealtime-ProtoKits` relative paths; direct curls returned 404 for those deployed URLs.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or a build-step import map.
- id: ecosystem-proof-009-e
  parent: ecosystem-proof-009
  lesson: Experiments aggregate validation still omits the DSK first-wave smoke.
  evidence: `origin/0.0.2:package.json` `check` script does not list `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`; `npm run check` passed and targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed separately.
  look further: Add the DSK proof smoke to an aggregate check or document it as required targeted release evidence.
- id: ecosystem-proof-009-f
  parent: ecosystem-proof-009
  lesson: Expanded ProtoKits fluid/water surfaces are locally validated but not public-browser proven.
  evidence: ProtoKits `npm run check` ran `tests/fluid-water-kits.test.mjs`; package exports include fluid/water kits; public first-wave route still fails before executing proof code.
  look further: Add browser-visible proof rows for expanded surfaces after first-wave public module loading works.
- id: ecosystem-proof-009-g
  parent: ecosystem-proof-009
  lesson: Receipt integrity now belongs in the DSK hardening proof backlog.
  evidence: DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T07-24-53-0400` adds receipt identity, event idempotency, claim policy, and request identity gates; deep bug node `2026-06-19T06-53-41-0400` supplies source-level examples.
  look further: Keep receipt hardening fixtures separate from distribution/public-browser proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-009-h
  parent: ecosystem-proof-009
  lesson: Validation-generated Experiments flat-route wrappers can dirty sibling state during proof checks.
  evidence: Experiments `npm run check` generated 100 flat route wrappers; generated untracked wrappers were removed and one generated tracked formatting diff was restored; final Experiments status was clean.
  look further: Consider an idempotent generation strategy or explicit cleanup expectation outside this scout lane.
