# Domain And Kit Idea Expansion Packet: 2026-06-19T22-01-38-0400

## Timestamp
- local: 2026-06-19T22-01-38-0400
- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-19-2101`.
- Latest current-lane packet added AR Launch And Spatial Read Model Domain, AR launch preconditions, mode selection policy, launch-state isolation, SpatialRoom getter isolation, and AR/spatial proof rows.
- Latest ecosystem state packet says core remains current and validation-green, while ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof, and public browser proof remain blocked by module-source strategy.
- Latest DSK architecture packet keeps runtime failure-boundary first, lifecycle parity second, query/command semantics third, experience-edge fourth, read-model/orchestration fifth, compatibility/content-safety sixth, and AR/spatial read-model seventh.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet keeps local, fetched-ref, aggregate, targeted, browser, npm, package-version, runtime hardening, and AR/spatial read-model proof claims separate.
- Latest deep bug packet adds proof-signal evidence: ARExperience terminal completion repeats, `createHitTestSource()` rejection escapes, `engine.tick()` accepts negative deltas, and greybox/SpatialRoom scale can become `NaN`.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, source snippets, and preflight were treated as authority for this run.

## Ideas added
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`
  - Proof Signal Integrity Domain for terminal receipt idempotency, WebXR hit-test failure policy, monotonic tick time, finite spatial scale, and proof signal integrity rows.
- `docs/kits_ideas.md`
  - `experience-terminal-receipt-kit`
  - `webxr-hit-test-failure-policy-kit`
  - `monotonic-tick-time-kit`
  - `finite-spatial-scale-kit`
  - `proof-signal-integrity-kit`
- `docs/described_examples.md`
  - Proof Signal Integrity Harness joining terminal receipts, device helper failures, time policy, spatial config normalization, and proof domains.

## Ideas deferred
- Direct fixes for `src/ar-experience-kit.js`, `src/ar-session.js`, `src/engine.js`, `src/greybox-building-kit.js`, and `src/spatial-room-kit.js` were deferred because this lane cannot edit source or tests.
- A second AR Launch And Spatial Read Model Domain was not added because this pass is about proof-signal receipt/time/config integrity, not launcher composition or SpatialRoom getter isolation.
- A second Simulation Time Policy Domain was not added because the existing time domain covers catch-up and fixed-step semantics; this pass narrows to normal tick monotonicity as a proof signal.
- A second Experience Edge Contract Domain was not added because ARExperience final receipt idempotency is a proof-counter issue, not a broader presentation/content edge contract.
- A second Config Normalization Domain was not added because finite scale is only one proof geometry row and does not justify a duplicate config family.
- Executable fixture work was deferred because this lane is planning inventory only.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate `completion-idempotency-kit`; `experience-terminal-receipt-kit` narrows to ARExperience final receipts, manual complete behavior, reset-after-complete, and proof event counts.
- Did not duplicate `launch-fallback-chain-kit`; `webxr-hit-test-failure-policy-kit` covers helper-level rejection/nullable policy after session setup, not mode fallback selection.
- Did not duplicate `time-step-catchup-kit`; `monotonic-tick-time-kit` covers negative normal deltas and forward-time proof semantics, not catch-up scheduling.
- Did not duplicate `descriptor-normalization-kit`; `finite-spatial-scale-kit` narrows to scale/geometry numeric guarantees across GreyboxBuilding, SpatialRoom, AR anchors, and render descriptors.
- Did not duplicate `ar-spatial-read-model-proof-kit`; `proof-signal-integrity-kit` groups receipt, helper failure, time, and finite config proof rows rather than AR launch state or SpatialRoom getter read models.

## DSK boundary notes
- These rows are NexusRealtime core validation-surface inventory because the fresh evidence is in exported runtime/browser/spatial primitives: `src/ar-experience-kit.js`, `src/ar-session.js`, `src/engine.js`, `src/greybox-building-kit.js`, and `src/spatial-room-kit.js`.
- The new rows do not imply new gameplay or product kits; they define proof-signal invariants for existing core behavior.
- ProtoKits and Experiments may consume the guarantees later, but implementation belongs in core only if a non-scout lane hardens AR experience receipts, WebXR helper failure, tick time policy, or spatial scale normalization.
- Public module-source strategy remains separate; fixing browser imports would not prove receipt counts, hit-test rejection handling, monotonic time, or finite spatial scale.

## Open questions
- Should ARExperience final completion be emitted only on incomplete-to-complete transitions, or should terminal state expose a separate persistent read model?
- Should `arExperience.complete()` emit directly, tick, or only enqueue a completion action to avoid duplicate receipts?
- Should `createHitTestSource()` return `null`, a frozen unsupported object, or throw for permission/runtime failures?
- Should `engine.tick()` reject negative deltas, clamp them to zero, or route rewind through an explicit replay API that does not publish normal forward-time surfaces?
- Should invalid greybox/spatial scale default, clamp, or reject before entering SpatialRoom and render descriptors?
- Should proof-signal integrity become tranche 8 after AR/spatial read-model, or should individual rows merge into receipt, launch, time, and config tranches?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, or `.agent` files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route or module-source strategy was fixed.
- No ProtoKits or Experiments fetched-ref validation was performed by this lane.
- No npm publication or deployment was performed.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
