# Domain And Kit Idea Expansion Packet: 2026-06-19T09-00-53-0400

## Timestamp
- local: 2026-06-19T09-00-53-0400
- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-19-0800`.
- Latest current-lane packet added Bridge State Ownership Domain, bridge phase policy, step transition receipts, delegated action reconciliation, wrapper state contracts, and bridge-state proof inventory.
- Latest ecosystem state packet says core and ProtoKits remain release-aligned and validation-green, but Experiments fetched `origin/0.0.2` is ahead of the clean local checkout while public browser proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy, generated-route cleanliness, and DSK hardening/bridge-state gates remain open.
- Latest DSK architecture packet adds bridge phase delivery, step-transition receipts, delegated-action reconciliation, and wrapper state contracts to DSK promotion fixture gates.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet says core and ProtoKits align with latest release refs and targeted DSK proof passes, but Experiments latest-ref proof is reopened, public proof remains stuck at `Booting...`, aggregate DSK proof remains separate, and ProtoKits aggregate validation was incomplete in that run.
- Latest deep bug packet adds source-state integrity gaps: WaterSurface/RouteField/RenderDescriptor nested config/reset leaks, EconomyKit `ledgerLimit:0` retention inversion, and PursuitPressure initial caught-state contradiction without caught/recovered receipts.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, source snippets, preflight, and direct file inspection were treated as authority for this run.

## Ideas added
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`
  - Source State Integrity Domain for authored-source isolation, reset-from-source guarantees, retention-limit normalization, and initial terminal-state receipt policy.
- `docs/kits_ideas.md`
  - `authored-source-isolation-kit`
  - `reset-source-policy-kit`
  - `retention-limit-policy-kit`
  - `initial-terminal-receipt-kit`
  - `source-state-integrity-proof-kit`
- `docs/described_examples.md`
  - Source State Integrity Harness joining authored-source, reset-source, retention, initial-terminal, and proof services.

## Ideas deferred
- Direct fixes for WaterSurfaceKit, RouteFieldKit, RenderDescriptorKit, EconomyKit, and PursuitPressureKit were deferred because this lane cannot edit source or tests.
- A broad Config Normalization Domain was not duplicated because it already exists; this run narrows the new inventory to nested authored-source isolation, reset-source reporting, retention-limit semantics, and initial terminal receipts.
- A broad Operations Data Integrity Domain was not duplicated because the latest evidence spans water, route, render descriptors, economy ledgers, and pursuit pressure, not only operations service-flow data.
- A generic Terminal State Policy Domain was not duplicated because `initial-terminal-receipt-kit` focuses on derived initial state and first receipt truth, not the full terminal/recoverable policy family.
- Public proof route import-map or Experiments latest-ref validation work was deferred because it belongs to proof/experiment lanes, not this idea lane.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate `immutable-config-kit`; `authored-source-isolation-kit` narrows to nested caller-owned object isolation across dataset services.
- Did not duplicate `restored-resource-state-kit`; `reset-source-policy-kit` narrows to reset-from-source proof and runtime-field scrubbing.
- Did not duplicate `retention-policy-kit`; `retention-limit-policy-kit` narrows to zero, negative, and non-finite retention semantics for ledgers, telemetry, and proof history.
- Did not duplicate `finite-transaction-policy-kit`; the new ledger idea concerns evidence retention limits, not transaction amount validity.
- Did not duplicate `terminal-state-policy-kit`; `initial-terminal-receipt-kit` narrows to initial terminal derivation and first caught/recovered receipt policy.
- Did not duplicate `proof-coverage-matrix-kit`; `source-state-integrity-proof-kit` narrows proof rows to source isolation, reset source, retention limits, and initial terminal receipts.

## DSK boundary notes
- Source-state integrity should start as ProtoKit planning inventory because it describes reusable policy kits and proof rows for dataset-heavy services.
- NexusRealtime core changes would only be appropriate if later implementation exposes missing runtime/DSK primitives for reset-source contracts, serializable snapshot enforcement, or generic validation fixtures.
- Authored-source isolation should distinguish caller-owned config, runtime-owned normalized state, restored state, and reset output.
- Retention-limit policy should define whether `0` means no retained entries, a rejected config, or a normalized minimum; this should be shared before economy, telemetry, or proof ledgers are promoted.
- Initial terminal receipts should make initial caught/lost/completed state explicit rather than relying on a later tick to discover terminal state.

## Open questions
- Should authored-source isolation clone, freeze, or both clone and freeze nested datasets at install time?
- Should reset-source policy report differences between authored, restored, and runtime-mutated state, or only guarantee clean reset output?
- Should zero retention mean no history, invalid config, or a minimum of one entry for auditability?
- Should initial terminal states emit events on install/reset, expose receipt history, or only normalize state before the first tick?
- Should source-state integrity proof rows be a standalone harness or a required section inside DSK promotion fixtures for dataset-heavy kits?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, or `.agent` files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route was fixed.
- No Experiments latest-ref validation was performed.
- No npm publication or deployment was performed.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
