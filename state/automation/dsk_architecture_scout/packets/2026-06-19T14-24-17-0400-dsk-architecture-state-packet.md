# DSK Architecture State Packet

## Timestamp
- 2026-06-19T14-24-17-0400

## Lane Goal
- Audit DSK architecture, contracts, invariants, scaling, and promotion risk for long-term NexusRealtime production viability.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `dsk-traversal-proof-fixture-root-2026-06-19-1324`.
- Latest DSK packet `2026-06-19T13-24-43-0400` kept core release-aligned and test-green, but added traversal proof integrity rows to the non-scout fixture handoff.
- Latest ecosystem state node `2026-06-19T14-10-45-0400` says core remains current and validation-green while ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments targeted proof, and public browser proof still reduce to one module-source strategy problem.
- Latest ecosystem proof node `2026-06-19T13-40-31-0400` keeps local proof, fetched-ref proof, aggregate proof, targeted DSK proof, public browser proof, npm availability, and runtime hardening separate.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-19T13-53-17-0400` adds runtime failure-boundary evidence: partial failed DSK installs, reserved `apiName:"__proto__"` prototype mutation, direct non-`n:` dependency bypass, and failed-tick event replay.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-19T14-00-58-0400` maps those failure-boundary bugs into planning inventory.
- State packets were context only. Live source, docs, tests, preflight, git refs, and focused probes were authority for this run.

  - Result before this packet: no source/test/runtime diff; pre-existing tracked diffs in expansion docs and this lane tracker.
- `npm test`
  - Result: pass, 8 smoke tests.
- Focused `node --input-type=module` DSK/failure-boundary probe
  - Result: reconfirmed reserved `apiName:"__proto__"` is not an own namespace key, failed API collision leaves partial DSK state and false same-object reinstall success, direct install allows missing `runtime:missing`, and failed-tick events publish with the next successful tick.

## DSK contract state
- `defineRuntimeKit()` remains the low-level installable primitive for components, resources, events, systems, bindings, registries, sequences, sequence nodes, metadata, and install hooks.
- `defineDomainServiceKit()` still wraps runtime kits with required domain/stability/version metadata, default `n-<domain>-kit` ids, `n:` capability tokens, optional service tokens, and `engine.n.<apiName>` installation (`src/domain-service-kit.js:165-190`).
- DSK metadata still describes linear execution with async-ready, serializable-state, reset, and snapshot expectations (`src/domain-service-kit.js:135-139`), but those expectations are metadata, not enforced runtime boundaries.
- `engine.n` is still created as a plain object and late API assignment happens inside the DSK install hook (`src/domain-service-kit.js:143-160`).
- `installRuntimeKit()` still records DSK metadata, bindings, kit identity, world state, registries, scheduler systems, sequence runtimes, and sequence-node state before late `kit.install()` can throw (`src/runtime-kit.js:135-215`).
- Direct DSK install still enforces only missing `n:` requirements (`src/runtime-kit.js:142-145`), while `createGameKitComposer()` checks every `requires` token during composition (`src/game-kit-composer.js:49-76`).
- `engine.tick()` still advances clock before scheduler execution and has no failure cleanup around `scheduler.run()` (`src/engine.js:168-214`); world events and journal records drain/clear only after all systems finish (`src/ecs.js:251-269`, `src/ecs.js:344-370`).
- Public exports and DSK smoke coverage remain present (`src/index.js:28-41`, `tests/domain-service-kit-smoke.mjs:64-134`, `tests/public-api-freeze.mjs:19-24`).

## Invariant coverage
- Covered today: DSK export presence, basic creation/validation, metadata shape, token generation, DSK extension duplicate checks, direct missing `n:` requirement failure, basic API install, serializable snapshot happy path, idempotent same-object reinstall, same-id duplicate rejection, and normal API collision throw.
- Still not covered: reserved API names, own-property namespace guarantees, failed-install rollback, false success after failed same-object reinstall, direct non-`n:` dependency policy, duplicate provider-token diagnostics, reset/snapshot absence/failure/non-serializable behavior, async metadata boundaries, source-state isolation, state-signal contracts, receipt identity, event idempotency, bridge phase, wrapper state, operations finite data, spatial/mobility bounds, lifecycle/config policy, traversal proof integrity, and scheduler failed-tick event lifetime.
- Focused probe evidence:
  - Reserved API: `engine.n` had no own `__proto__` key, but `engine.n.marker` and `Object.getPrototypeOf(engine.n).marker` both returned `"__proto__-api"`.
  - Failed install: first install threw `cannot overwrite engine.n.collision`; same-object reinstall returned no error; `engine.kits` and `engine.domainServiceKits` retained `n-late-collision-kit`; the API still pointed at the old value.
  - Dependency parity: a DSK requiring `runtime:missing` installed directly and exposed `engine.n.needsRuntime.ready === true`.
  - Scheduler failure: first tick threw `boom once`; second successful tick published one event batch containing both `{ frame:1, marker:"failed-tick" }` and `{ frame:2, marker:"recovery-tick" }`; clock advanced to frame `2`, elapsed `0.5`.

## Domain and kit expansion architecture notes
- Repo memory and docs keep the ownership split stable: core owns ECS/runtime/DSK/composer primitives and validation invariants; ProtoKits owns new reusable implementations; Experiments owns browser/playable proof.
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md` says new reusable kits belong in NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, while core receives DSK contract, validation, scheduler, ECS, or runtime primitive changes.
- New failure-boundary idea rows belong to core validation surfaces because they describe runtime/DSK/scheduler invariants, not gameplay-kit implementation.
- Module-source/public-proof blockers remain ecosystem proof work, not DSK hardening proof.
- The DSK architecture implication is now narrower and stronger: the non-scout fixture handoff should include runtime failure-boundary rows alongside prior namespace/install/dependency, traversal, lifecycle/config, source-state, state-signal, receipt, bridge, operations, and spatial rows.

## Scaling risks
- Broad DSK promotion increases `engine.n` collision, inherited-key, reserved-key, and ownership risks while `engine.n` remains a normal object.
- Partial installs can leave metadata, kit lists, bindings, world state, scheduler state, sequence runtimes, or namespace APIs inconsistent after a late throw.
- Same-object reinstall can falsely report success after a failed late DSK install.
- Direct-install and composer dependency behavior can diverge for the same kit graph.
- Failed ticks can leak failed-frame events into later successful surfaces, corrupting analytics, SequenceNode bridges, objective receipts, and proof harnesses.
- Metadata-only reset/snapshot/async expectations are too weak for replay, restore, worker, network, or long-lived engine claims.
- Public/browser proof, sibling fetched-ref validation, aggregate validation, npm availability, and package-version policy can drift independently from runtime hardening.

## Bug candidates
- Confirmed: reserved namespace API key. `apiName:"__proto__"` installs through prototype behavior without an own `engine.n` slot.
- Confirmed: failed API collision install is non-atomic and same-object reinstall returns success without installing the promised API.
- Confirmed/design gap: direct DSK install allows missing non-`n:` requirements while composer rejects unresolved `requires`.
- Confirmed: thrown systems can replay failed-tick events on the next successful tick.
- Carried confirmed DSK hardening inputs: traversal negative costs, duplicate navmesh identities, procedural signature gaps, recovery receipt/state mismatch, lifecycle/config gaps, source-state leaks, state-signal gaps, receipt identity/idempotency gaps, bridge/wrapper-state gaps, operations finite-data gaps, and spatial/mobility bounds.
- Candidate: the first non-scout hardening fixture should now be named around runtime failure boundaries, not more broad architecture scouting.

## Missing tests
- Reserved `apiName` handling for `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`.
- Own-property assertions for every installed `engine.n` API and null-prototype namespace behavior.
- Failed install rollback after API collision, `initWorld` throw, registry throw, scheduler add throw, sequence runtime throw, sequence node runtime throw, and install hook throw.
- Same-object reinstall after failed install should remain retryable or fail clearly until rollback is complete.
- Direct install parity or documented divergence for non-`n:` `requires` tokens.
- Scheduler throw fixtures for before/after emit, clock commit, event queue clearing, journal clearing, lifecycle diagnostics, and next-tick surface publication.
- Duplicate provider-token diagnostics across different DSK ids.
- End-to-end `extendDomainServiceKit()` install behavior.
- Reset/snapshot absence, failure, non-serializable state, restore, and reset policy coverage.
- Async metadata tests that explicitly prove async is metadata-only today.
- Aggregate DSK hardening fixture wiring that keeps runtime hardening, targeted proof, public browser proof, latest-ref sibling proof, npm availability, and package-version policy separate.

## Promotion risks
- Do not promote broad ProtoKit or domain idea graphs into core until namespace safety, install atomicity, dependency policy, failed-tick event semantics, state contract enforcement, service-call policy, receipt integrity, bridge phase, wrapper-state contracts, source-state integrity, state-signal contracts, lifecycle/config policy, traversal proof integrity, operations data, and spatial bounds are designed and tested.
- Do not claim async DSK execution, worker readiness, network partitioning, replay/restore support, or production DSK safety from metadata and smoke tests alone.
- Do not treat public route HTTP 200, GitHub/raw/jsDelivr availability, local targeted proof, fetched aggregate proof, or Playwright launch visibility as runtime hardening proof.
- Do not claim npm package availability; optional npm metadata remains 404.
- Do not claim sibling fetched-ref proof is fully green; neighboring state/proof packets report module-source blockers.
- Do not treat idea docs as canonical public architecture or promotion approval.

## Suggested next review item
- Use a non-scout lane to write the smallest executable DSK/runtime failure-boundary hardening fixture set:
  - `engine.n` reserved-key/null-prototype/own-property namespace policy
  - install preflight/rollback transaction boundaries and retry semantics
  - direct-install dependency parity versus composer-only policy
  - scheduler failed-tick clock/event/journal/lifecycle policy
  - reset/snapshot/serialization enforcement or explicit metadata-only policy
  - traversal proof integrity rows
  - lifecycle/config, source-state, state-signal, receipt, bridge, wrapper, operations, and spatial rows carried from earlier packets

## Not claimed
- No bugs were fixed.
- No source, tests, docs, examples, package metadata, repo memory, public claims, `.agent` files, ProtoKits, Experiments, or deployments were edited.
- Passing `npm test` does not prove production DSK readiness.
- This packet does not prove browser UX, public proof completion, npm publication, sibling latest-ref validation, async execution, worker/network readiness, replay/restore support, or broad domain graph promotion.
