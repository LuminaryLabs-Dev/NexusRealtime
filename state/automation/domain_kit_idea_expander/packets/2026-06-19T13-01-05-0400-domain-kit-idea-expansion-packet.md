# Domain And Kit Idea Expansion Packet: 2026-06-19T13-01-05-0400

## Timestamp

- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-19-1201`.
- Latest current-lane packet added Service Lifecycle And Config Domain, command lifecycle, elapsed-rate, descriptor normalization, generated geometry bounds, and lifecycle/config proof inventory.
- Latest ecosystem state packet says core remains latest-ref aligned and validation-green, while ProtoKits and Experiments latest-ref proof, public browser proof, aggregate DSK proof, npm metadata, package-version policy, and DSK hardening fixtures remain open.
- Latest DSK architecture packet says executable DSK hardening fixtures must now include lifecycle/config rows in addition to earlier namespace, install, dependency, source-state, signal, receipt, bridge, operations, and spatial rows.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet says local available-checkout DSK proof remains green, but fetched-ref and public proof share module-resolution blockers.
- Latest deep bug packet adds navigation/procedural/physics failures: negative pathfinding costs, duplicate navmesh/waypoint identity, procedural signatures that ignore algorithm descriptors, and duplicate/stale WorldPhysics recovery receipts/state.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, source snippets, preflight, and direct file inspection were treated as authority for this run.

## Ideas added
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`
  - Traversal Proof Integrity Domain for navigation cost policy, navmesh identity, procedural signature taxonomy, recovery receipt/state consistency, and proof rows.
- `docs/kits_ideas.md`
  - `navigation-cost-policy-kit`
  - `navmesh-identity-policy-kit`
  - `procedural-signature-taxonomy-kit`
  - `recovery-receipt-state-kit`
  - `traversal-proof-integrity-kit`
- `docs/described_examples.md`
  - Traversal Proof Integrity Harness joining pathfinding, navmesh, procedural signature, recovery state, and proof domains.

## Ideas deferred
- Direct fixes for PathfindingKit, NavMeshKit, ProceduralKit, and WorldPhysicsKit were deferred because this lane cannot edit source or tests.
- A second Service Lifecycle And Config Domain was not added because the newest evidence is traversal-proof specific: cost policy, graph identity, signature taxonomy, and recovery state.
- A second Generated Geometry Bounds kit was not added because that idea covers finite generated coordinates; this run narrows to procedural signature taxonomy and proof metadata drift.
- A second Receipt Integrity Domain was not added because recovery receipt/state consistency needs one-shot recovery plus final-state agreement, not generic receipt id assignment.
- Public proof module resolution and sibling fetched-ref validation were deferred because those belong to proof/ecosystem lanes, not this idea lane.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate `stable-id-allocation-kit`; `navmesh-identity-policy-kit` focuses on walkability keys and emitted navmesh/graph ids after source data is converted.
- Did not duplicate `request-identity-policy-kit` or `hazard-identity-policy-kit`; navmesh identity is a graph/topology identity problem, not request or hazard identity.
- Did not duplicate `descriptor-invalidation-kit`; `procedural-signature-taxonomy-kit` defines which content, topology, algorithm/config, and proof fields should participate in signatures.
- Did not duplicate `generated-geometry-bounds-kit`; traversal proof integrity consumes finite generation policy but adds cost, graph identity, signature, and recovery rows.
- Did not duplicate `event-idempotency-kit`; `recovery-receipt-state-kit` combines one-shot recovery receipts with final recovered-state consistency.
- Did not duplicate `proof-coverage-matrix-kit`; `traversal-proof-integrity-kit` narrows proof rows to navigation/procedural/physics traversal surfaces.

## DSK boundary notes
- Traversal proof integrity policies should start as ProtoKit planning inventory because they describe reusable proof rows and service policies across domain kits.
- NexusRealtime core changes would only be appropriate if later implementation exposes missing runtime/DSK primitives for invalid-cost rejection, graph identity assertions, signature helper taxonomy, or recovery event/state validation.
- Navigation cost policy should reject or normalize negative, non-finite, and unbounded costs before A* and proof surfaces treat a route as valid.
- Navmesh identity policy should distinguish source key uniqueness from emitted cell, portal, waypoint, and link identity uniqueness.
- Procedural signature taxonomy should clarify content, topology, algorithm/config, and proof signatures instead of relying on one opaque snapshot signature.
- Recovery receipt/state policy should require one recovery receipt per recovery action and final published state that matches the recovered resource.

## Open questions
- Should negative traversal costs be rejected, clamped to zero, normalized to a minimum positive value, or treated as blocked cells?
- Should duplicate walkability keys fail fast, be disambiguated by coordinates, or produce diagnostics while still emitting canonical ids?
- Should procedural snapshots publish separate content, topology, algorithm/config, and proof signatures, or one expanded signature with named inputs?
- Should recovery receipt/state consistency live with physics/traversal kits, receipt policy kits, or DSK hardening fixtures?
- Should traversal proof rows be a standalone harness or folded into the first executable DSK hardening fixture set?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, or `.agent` files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route was fixed.
- No ProtoKits or Experiments fetched-ref validation was performed.
- No npm publication or deployment was performed.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
