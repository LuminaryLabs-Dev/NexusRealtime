# DSK Architecture State Packet: 2026-06-20T04-22-52-0400

## Timestamp

- automation: Nexus Realtime: DSK Architecture State Packet

## Lane Goal
- Audit DSK architecture, contracts, invariants, scaling, and promotion risk for long-term NexusRealtime production viability.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `dsk-runtime-identity-lifecycle-context-root-2026-06-20-0323`.
- Latest DSK packet kept runtime failure-boundary as tranche 1, while runtime identity/lifecycle rows joined later hardening inventory and module-source proof stayed separate.
- Latest ecosystem state node `2026-06-20T04-10-40-0400` says core remains current and smoke-green, while local/fetched ProtoKits, local/fetched targeted Experiments, public browser proof, npm metadata, and package-version policy remain separate module-source/proof blockers.
- Latest ecosystem proof node `2026-06-20T03-41-33-0400` keeps local, fetched-ref, aggregate, targeted, browser, npm, package-version, hardening, and proof claims separate.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-20T03-55-08-0400` adds Fishing/ReefRescue boundary, runtime identity, and objective validation findings.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-20T04-01-35-0400` maps those findings into Content Boundary And Objective Contract planning inventory, not a module-source or runtime failure-boundary replacement.
- State packets were context only. Live source, docs, tests, git refs, preflight, and focused probes were treated as authority.

## DSK contract state
- `defineRuntimeKit()` remains the low-level installable kit primitive for components, resources, events, systems, registries, sequences, SequenceNode fields, bindings, metadata, and install hooks (`src/runtime-kit.js:35-59`).
- `defineDomainServiceKit()` still wraps RuntimeKit with `n:` tokens, stable `n-<domain>-kit` ids, required version/stability metadata, linear execution metadata, and `engine.n.<apiName>` installation (`src/domain-service-kit.js:123-195`).
- DSK metadata still declares async-ready, serializable state, snapshot, and reset expectations while current execution remains scheduler-linear (`src/domain-service-kit.js:131-139`; `README.md:136-140`).
- `engine.n` is still initialized as a normal object and assigned late through the wrapped install hook (`src/domain-service-kit.js:143-161`).
- `installRuntimeKit()` still records DSK metadata, kit bindings, and kit identity before `initWorld`, registry, scheduler, SequenceNode, and install hooks can throw (`src/runtime-kit.js:135-215`).
- Direct DSK installation still checks only missing `n:` requirements, while `createGameKitComposer()` resolves every required token before composition (`src/runtime-kit.js:142-145`; `src/game-kit-composer.js:49-76`).
- Public exports still include DSK, RuntimeKit, composer, SequenceNode, AR/session/launch APIs, domain primitives, `createFishingKit()`, and `createReefRescueKit()` (`src/index.js:28-210`; `src/index.js:114-120`).

## Invariant coverage
- Covered by smoke tests: export presence, basic DSK validation, metadata shape, token creation, extension duplicate checks, missing `n:` rejection, normal API installation, serializable snapshot happy path, same-object reinstall idempotency, same-id duplicate rejection, and normal API collision throw (`tests/domain-service-kit-smoke.mjs:64-135`; `tests/public-api-freeze.mjs:16-24`; `tests/run-all.mjs:3-11`).
- Not covered: reserved API names, own-property namespace policy, failed-install rollback, direct non-`n:` dependency parity, duplicate provider/binding diagnostics, ECS definition-name collision policy, SequenceNode duplicate type policy, install-only kit idempotency, event-history isolation, disposed listener parity, scheduler failed-tick lifetime, reset/snapshot failure, async metadata truth, product-themed core export policy, preset runtime id policy, and objective/content validation.
- Focused probe evidence:
  - reserved API: `own:false`, `keys:[]`, `inheritedMarker:"__proto__-api"`, `protoMarker:"__proto__-api"`.
  - failed clean API collision: first collision threw, second same-object reinstall returned `n-late-collision-clean-kit`, API owner stayed `existing`, and `engine.kits`/`engine.domainServiceKits` retained the failed kit.
  - dependency parity: direct install with `requires:["runtime:missing"]` installed `n-needs-runtime-kit` and exposed `engine.n.needsRuntime.ready:true`.
  - binding ownership: composer and engine both kept duplicate binding `service` from second kit `binding-b`.
  - Fishing/ReefRescue identity/objective: `createFishingKit({ id:"custom-fishing" })` and `createReefRescueKit({ id:"reef-custom" })` both returned runtime id `fishing`; zero-target fishing objective became `status:"complete"` with `caught:0` after one tick.

## Domain and kit expansion architecture notes
- Core/ProtoKits/Experiments ownership stayed stable: core owns runtime, ECS, scheduler, DSK contract, composer, stable primitives, and validation surfaces; ProtoKits owns new reusable domain implementations; Experiments owns playable/browser proof (`docs/how-to-protokit.md:7-15`, `docs/how-to-protokit.md:53-68`, `docs/how-to-protokit.md:99-105`).
- Fresh content boundary/objective rows are DSK-adjacent because content-driven kits and proof routes can look reusable or complete while exporting themed presets from core, sharing runtime ids, or accepting invalid authored criteria (`docs/domain_ideas.md:1133-1162`; `docs/kits_ideas.md:1064-1100`; `docs/described_examples.md:1002-1030`).
- Runtime failure-boundary remains tranche 1 because namespace safety, failed installs, direct/composer dependency parity, scheduler failed-tick semantics, and metadata truth affect all DSK promotion.
- Content boundary/objective should be a later validation tranche. It matters for promoted content kits and proof claims, but it does not supersede base runtime failure-boundary, runtime identity/lifecycle, or composition-proof ownership.
- Product-specific ReefRescue content should not become a new core domain family. While it remains exported from core, the useful core work is boundary/compatibility validation, not adding more product kits.
- Public module-source strategy remains an ecosystem/proof decision. Fixing public imports or npm metadata would not prove namespace safety, rollback, dependency parity, preset identity, or objective/content semantics.

## Scaling risks
- Broad DSK promotion still increases collision, inherited-key, and ownership risks while `engine.n` is a normal object.
- Partial installs can leave DSK metadata, kit identity, bindings, world mutations, registries, systems, sequence runtimes, or service APIs inconsistent after late throws.
- Direct install and composer dependency behavior can diverge for the same dependency-bearing DSK graph.
- Duplicate binding names can make service wiring appear deterministic while last-writer-wins behavior hides ownership.
- Product-themed core exports can normalize putting reusable gameplay/content in the runtime package instead of ProtoKits or Experiments.
- First-party factories that ignore caller ids make multi-variant composition, diagnostics, and preset ownership ambiguous.
- Invalid objective thresholds can let proof surfaces report completion without action evidence.
- Split content validation can produce placeholder entities and false completion through different fallback paths.
- Local/fetched/public DSK proof can regress independently of core smoke tests when module-source policy is implicit.

## Bug candidates
- Confirmed: reserved `apiName:"__proto__"` installs through prototype behavior without an own `engine.n` slot.
- Confirmed: failed late API collision is non-atomic and same-object reinstall returns success without installing the promised API.
- Confirmed/design gap: direct DSK install allows missing non-`n:` requirements that composer-based installation would reject.
- Confirmed: runtime binding names silently overwrite across composer and direct install.
- Confirmed/current: `createReefRescueKit()` exports themed reef rescue content from NexusRealtime core despite current core/ProtoKit boundary docs (`src/reef-rescue-kit.js:4-91`; `src/index.js:118-120`).
- Confirmed/current: `createFishingKit()` ignores `options.id`, and ReefRescue cannot create a stable distinct runtime id because both return `id:"fishing"` (`src/fishing-kit.js:683-704`; `src/reef-rescue-kit.js:73-91`).
- Confirmed/current: zero fishing objectives complete with zero catches because `caught >= objective.target` accepts `0` (`src/fishing-kit.js:572-584`; `src/fishing-kit.js:794-801`).
- Carried: ECS definition identity, SequenceNode type policy/history/install-only/disposed parity, duplicate provider ownership, failed-tick replay, lifecycle parity, query/command semantics, experience-edge, read-model/orchestration, compatibility/content-safety, AR/spatial read-model, proof-signal integrity, traversal, source-state, state-signal, receipt, bridge, operations, and spatial rows remain fixture inventory.

## Missing tests
- Reserved `apiName` handling for `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`, inherited keys, and own-property service lookup.
- Null-prototype or reserved-key namespace policy for `engine.n`.
- Failed install rollback/retryability for API collision, `createApi` throw, install hook throw, `initWorld` throw, registry throw, scheduler add throw, sequence runtime throw, and SequenceNode runtime throw.
- Direct install versus composer dependency policy for `n:*`, `runtime:*`, kit ids, and custom capability tokens.
- Duplicate provider-token diagnostics and duplicate binding-name diagnostics with owner lookup and explicit override policy.
- Duplicate ECS component/resource/event definition policy across direct and composed installs.
- SequenceNode duplicate type registration, event-bus history clone/freeze behavior, raw install-only idempotency, and disposed listener parity.
- Public API boundary fixture for themed/product exports in core.
- FishingKit/ReefRescue factory identity fixture for default id, caller id, multiple instances, composer/direct install parity, and metadata ownership.
- Objective threshold fixtures for missing, zero, negative, fractional, string, NaN, and explicit disabled-objective semantics.
- Content dataset validation fixture spanning species, lures, objectives, duplicate ids, unknown ids, placeholder prevention, and diagnostics.
- Reset/snapshot absence, failure, restore, non-serializable state behavior, and async metadata truth.
- Proof-readiness checks that keep local/fetched/browser/npm/package-version/module-source proof separate from runtime, composition, identity, and content-boundary hardening.

## Promotion risks
- Do not promote broad DSK graphs until runtime failure-boundary fixtures exist for namespace safety, install transaction semantics, dependency parity, scheduler failure lifetime, and metadata truth.
- Do not treat first-party content kits as clean promotion evidence while product-themed exports, fixed runtime ids, or invalid objective completion remain untested.
- Do not treat `createReefRescueKit()` as a new core-domain precedent; keep it as boundary/compatibility evidence unless a non-scout pass intentionally moves or deprecates it.
- Do not use zero-catch completion as proof success unless disabled-objective semantics are explicit.
- Do not treat `npm test`, HTTP 200 public routes, aggregate Experiments checks, fetched raw files, public CDN reachability, or npm metadata as production DSK safety.
- Do not move proof routing, package-resolution shims, browser routes, or reusable gameplay implementation into NexusRealtime core to solve distribution proof.

## Suggested next review item
- Use a non-scout lane to write the smallest executable tranche 1 fixture set: `engine.n` reserved-key/null-prototype/own-property policy, failed-install rollback/retryability, direct/composer dependency parity, scheduler failed-tick semantics, and reset/snapshot/async metadata truth.
- After tranche 1 starts, add runtime identity/lifecycle, composition-proof, and content-boundary/objective fixtures for duplicate bindings/providers, ECS definition identity, SequenceNode lifecycle, `createReefRescueKit()` boundary status, FishingKit preset identity, and objective/content validation.

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, docs, examples, package metadata, repo memory, public claims, `.agent` files, ProtoKits, Experiments, deployments, or release branches were edited.
- No bugs were fixed.
- No new tests were added.
- Playwright/Human View validation was not run for this DSK architecture scout because this pass had no UI/browser deliverable; neighboring ecosystem state/proof lanes carry current public browser proof status.
- Passing `npm test` does not prove production DSK readiness.
- This packet does not prove browser UX, public proof completion, npm publication, sibling fetched-ref validation, async execution, worker/network readiness, replay/restore support, lifecycle parity, query/command semantics, read-model/orchestration readiness, runtime identity/lifecycle readiness, composition-proof ownership readiness, content-boundary/objective readiness, AR/spatial readiness, proof-signal integrity, proof-readiness taxonomy, or broad domain graph promotion.
