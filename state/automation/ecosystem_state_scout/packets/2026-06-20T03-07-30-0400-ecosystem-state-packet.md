# Ecosystem State Packet: 2026-06-20T03-07-30-0400

## Scope
- Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem State Packet
- Local timestamp: 2026-06-20T03-07-30-0400
- UTC preflight timestamp: 2026-06-20T07:07:31.502Z
- Workspace: `/Users/crimsonwheeler/Documents/GitHub/NexusRealtime`
- Repos checked: NexusRealtime core, NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, NexusRealtime-Experiments

## Lane Goal
- Audit NexusRealtime ecosystem state, drift, and proof readiness across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, DSK promotion ledgers, branch targets, public links, and proof paths.

## Prior State Context
- Previous ecosystem root: `ecosystem-root-025`.
- Previous lesson: core remained current and smoke-green, but local ProtoKits, local Experiments targeted proof, ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof, and public browser proof all failed around unresolved `nexusrealtime` package or sibling module resolution.
- Latest DSK architecture node `2026-06-20T02-23-35-0400` adds composition-proof ownership rows while keeping runtime failure-boundary first and module-source proof separate.
- Latest ecosystem proof node `2026-06-20T02-40-59-0400` keeps the active proof blocker unchanged and notes Experiments fetched `origin/0.0.2` at `81b39bccadf2cdf8269df24cd4970a5b2d7ebbd9`.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-20T02-54-27-0400` adds runtime binding ownership, ECS definition identity, SequenceNode install-only idempotency, and event-bus disposed parity as hardening inventory.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-20T03-01-44-0400` maps those bugs into Runtime Identity And Lifecycle Ownership planning inventory, not a distribution proof fix.
- State packets/nodes were context only. Live source, docs, tests, git refs, public URLs, preflight, and Playwright launch state were treated as authority.

## Agent Workspace State
- Used agent-it mentality and read `.agent/start-here.md`, `.agent/operating-model.md`, `.agent/automation-rules.md`, `.agent/report-format.md`, `.agent/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, `.agent/CHANGE_LOG.md`, and `memory.md`.
- Used Human View Orchestration. Mandatory question: Have I checked what the human would actually see, and do I need screenshots, visual inspection, launch-state inspection, or before/after comparison to validate this properly? Answer: yes; public proof can return HTTP 200 while remaining stuck at boot.
- Used Playwright CLI wrapper for browser launch-state inspection. Snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and visible `Booting...`.
- Removed Playwright scratch files and disposable fetched-ref extraction folders created by this run.
- No source, tests, public docs, package metadata, deployment files, `.agent`, canonical memory, or sibling repo files were edited.

- Latest neighboring DSK architecture, ecosystem proof, deep bug, and domain idea packets/nodes through `2026-06-20T03-01-44-0400`
- Sibling ProtoKits `package.json`, `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js`, `docs/DSK-FIRST-WAVE-LEDGER.md`, `tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs`, local checkout, and fetched `origin/0.0.2`
- Sibling Experiments `package.json`, `experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/index.html`, `experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/src/proof.js`, `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`, local checkout, and fetched `origin/0.0.2`

## Ecosystem Findings
- Core remains aligned with the preflight-resolved latest remote release branch `0.0.2`; `HEAD` equals `origin/0.0.2`.
- Core validation passed: `npm test` passed all 8 smoke tests.
- Required core GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links remain reachable.
- Optional npm registry metadata remains unavailable with HTTP 404, so npm-backed consumption is still not proven.
- Branch/package policy risk remains unchanged: release branch `0.0.2` serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.
- ProtoKits fetched `origin/0.0.2` advanced during this run from the prior packet's `b1d6909` to `9ab73e086e06c345409a32c74791b45307dde4ac`.
- ProtoKits local checkout is clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`: local `f006fa3bbe5721b0aa073de2bca08a452bd8e492`, origin `9ab73e086e06c345409a32c74791b45307dde4ac`, ahead/behind `0 39`.
- ProtoKits local available-checkout validation remains red: `npm run check` syntax-checked 330 JavaScript modules, then `smoke:imports` failed with 110 ProtoKit index import failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`; targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` failed for the same package.
- ProtoKits disposable fetched-ref validation remains red: fetched `origin/0.0.2` at `9ab73e086e06c345409a32c74791b45307dde4ac` syntax-checked 362 JavaScript modules, then `smoke:imports` failed with 110 import failures rooted in missing package `nexusrealtime`; targeted DSK smoke failed for the same package.
- Experiments local checkout is clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`: local `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb`, origin `81b39bccadf2cdf8269df24cd4970a5b2d7ebbd9`, ahead/behind `0 10`.
- Experiments local targeted DSK validation remains red: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed because local ProtoKits `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js` could not resolve package `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref aggregate validation passed: `npm run check` generated 100 flat route wrappers and passed the aggregate smoke chain.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref targeted DSK validation still failed: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` could not resolve `/private/tmp/NexusRealtime/src/index.js` from sibling-relative proof imports.
- Public DSK proof remains HTTP-visible but not browser-complete: Playwright snapshot showed heading, description, and visible `Booting...`; console/requests showed repeated 404s for deployed sibling module paths.
- Experiments aggregate validation remains a separate green claim from targeted DSK proof; `package.json` aggregate check still does not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.

## Domain And Kit Expansion Signals
- Core/ProtoKits/Experiments ownership remains stable: core owns runtime/DSK/composer primitives, ProtoKits owns reusable implementations, and Experiments owns playable/browser proof.
- Latest neighboring lanes add composition-proof ownership and runtime identity/lifecycle ownership hardening rows.
- Those rows are useful core validation-surface inventory, but they do not change distribution proof status.
- The active promotion blocker remains one module-source strategy that works for local ProtoKits, fetched ProtoKits, local Experiments targeted proof, fetched Experiments targeted proof, aggregate-vs-targeted proof, and public browser loading.

## Evidence
- `npm run automation:preflight` passed and resolved latest branch `0.0.2`.
- Core `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2` returned `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0` for both refs.
- Core `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2` returned `0 0`.
- Core `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
- ProtoKits `git fetch --prune origin`, status, rev-parse, and ahead/behind checks showed local `f006fa3`, origin `9ab73e0`, and ahead/behind `0 39`.
- ProtoKits local `npm run check` failed after 330 syntax-checked modules; `smoke:imports` reported 110 import failures rooted in missing package `nexusrealtime`.
- ProtoKits local `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
- ProtoKits disposable extracted `origin/0.0.2` at `9ab73e086e06c345409a32c74791b45307dde4ac` failed aggregate and targeted checks on missing package `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments `git fetch --prune origin`, status, rev-parse, and ahead/behind checks showed local `799fad8`, origin `81b39bc`, and ahead/behind `0 10`.
- Experiments local `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime` from local ProtoKits `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js`.
- Experiments disposable extracted `origin/0.0.2` at `81b39bccadf2cdf8269df24cd4970a5b2d7ebbd9` passed `npm run check` and failed targeted DSK smoke on missing sibling `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
- Curl checks confirmed proof route/raw/CDN files remain public, while runtime dependency paths used by the public page remain 404.
- Playwright CLI opened the public DSK proof route; snapshot showed `Booting...`; console and request history showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.

## Suggested Canonical Updates
- Pick one module-source strategy for release proof: package/workspace dependency, CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or build-step import maps.
- Make ProtoKits declare or model `nexusrealtime` resolution explicitly before treating local or fetched ProtoKits validation as release evidence.
- Validate Experiments targeted DSK proof locally and from fetched `origin/0.0.2` with the same module-source strategy intended for public proof.
- Wire `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` into aggregate Experiments validation or document it as required targeted evidence.
- Update public consumption wording or release policy so docs distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch consumption from unavailable npm registry metadata.
- Decide whether branch `0.0.2` serving package version `0.1.0` is intentional policy or stale metadata.
- Keep composition-proof and runtime-identity hardening rows separate from public module-loading proof.

## Knowledge Nodes
- Wrote `state/automation/ecosystem_state_scout/knowledge_nodes/2026-06-20T03-07-30-0400-ecosystem-state-node.md`.
- New root lesson: core remains current and validation-green, while ecosystem proof remains blocked by one module-source strategy; ProtoKits latest fetched ref advanced to `9ab73e0` and is still unvalidated, local/fetched targeted DSK proof remains red, public browser proof remains stuck at `Booting...`, and newer hardening rows are separate inventory.

## Master Tracker Updates
- Added `ecosystem-root-026`.
- Marked `ecosystem-root-025` as superseded by `ecosystem-root-026`.
- Added child branches for ProtoKits latest-ref drift, local/fetched package-resolution proof, Experiments targeted proof, public browser proof, aggregate-vs-targeted proof, and hardening-boundary separation.
