# Ecosystem Proof State Packet

Timestamp: 2026-06-19T11:40:11-0400
Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem Proof State Packet
Scope: NexusRealtime core, NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, NexusRealtime-Experiments
Result: partial; core remains latest-ref aligned and validation-green, but fetched ProtoKits `origin/0.0.2` advanced 5 commits beyond the local checkout and fetched Experiments `origin/0.0.2` remains 24 commits ahead. Local available-checkout DSK proof passes, while public browser proof still stalls at `Booting...`.

## Lane Goal
- Audit proof coverage across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, public routes, and DSK expansion ideas.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `ecosystem-proof-012`.
- Latest proof packet/node `2026-06-19T10-45-02-0400` said core and ProtoKits were latest-ref aligned and validation-green, Experiments was 22 commits behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`, public browser proof failed at module loading, and state-signal hardening constrained promotion claims.
- Latest ecosystem state node `2026-06-19T11-08-56-0400` updated Experiments drift to 24 commits behind fetched `origin/0.0.2` while keeping public proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy, generated-route cleanliness, and DSK hardening gates open.
- Latest DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T11-23-07-0400` says the next high-value non-scout work is executable hardening fixtures for namespace/install/dependency plus source-state and state-signal contracts.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-19T09-54-20-0400` keeps placement invalidation, held-action repeat, transition, coordinate-axis, and camera derived-state gaps in proof readiness.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-19T10-02-21-0400` maps those gaps into state-signal contract proof rows.
- State packets were used for context only. Live source, fetched refs, commands, public URLs, and Playwright launch-state output are authority for this run.

## Latest branch
- `npm run automation:preflight` resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`.
- Preflight timestamp: `2026-06-19T15:37:37.441Z`.
- NexusRealtime local branch `0.0.2` at `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`, matching `origin/0.0.2`; ahead/behind `0/0`.
- ProtoKits local branch `0.0.2` at `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`; fetched `origin/0.0.2` is `06f5f3bd35e3b4c2c24d49d4affbe026b0d92c8f`; ahead/behind `0/5`.
- Experiments local branch `0.0.2` at `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f`; fetched `origin/0.0.2` is `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb`; ahead/behind `0/24`.
- Core package metadata remains `nexusrealtime@0.1.0`; raw public branch `0.0.2/package.json` is reachable.

## Commands run
- NexusRealtime: `npm run automation:preflight` -> passed; latest branch `0.0.2`; required GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links OK; optional npm metadata 404.
- NexusRealtime/ProtoKits/Experiments: `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`, `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2`.
- NexusRealtime: `npm test` -> passed 8 smoke tests.
- ProtoKits local available checkout: `npm run check` -> passed; checked 294 JavaScript modules, imported 236 ProtoKit indexes, skipped 2 remote URL forwarders, and ran the local smoke chain through fluid/water kit composition.
- ProtoKits targeted local available checkout: `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` -> passed.
- Experiments targeted local available checkout: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` -> passed.
- Experiments aggregate `npm run check` was not run because local and fetched scripts start with `npm run generate:flat-routes`, which writes generated route artifacts outside this lane's write scope.
- Fetched-ref inspections used `git show origin/0.0.2:package.json`, proof HTML/module reads, first-wave ledger reads, and `git log HEAD..origin/0.0.2`.
- Public URL checks used direct `curl -L -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"`.
- Human-view validation used Playwright CLI from `/tmp`: opened the public DSK proof route, captured snapshot, console, and network requests, then removed temporary `/tmp/.playwright-cli` scratch artifacts.
- Targeted `rg`/file inspections checked DSK aliases, `engine.n.*`, compatibility shims, public import maps, stale pins, aggregate scripts, proof coverage, and docs/how-to-experiment.md alignment.

## ProtoKits migration state
- First-wave DSK ledger remains public on raw `0.0.2` and still lists seven `promoted-candidate` kits: token-registry, completion-ledger, scan-survey, route-checkpoint, resource-pressure, zone-field, and hazard-director.
- Ledger still says all first-wave kits install through `nexus-dsk-adapter`, return `defineDomainServiceKit()` objects with the real NexusRealtime runtime, keep old injected-runtime calls as migration shims, and defer promotion into core.
- Direct-import aliases remain present locally: `createNZoneFieldKit`, `createNScanSurveyKit`, `createNRouteCheckpointKit`, `createNResourcePressureKit`, `createNHazardDirectorKit`, `createNTokenRegistryKit`, and `createNCompletionLedgerKit`.
- Local available-checkout first-wave migration test passed and still proves direct `createN...Kit()` usage, `engine.n.*` APIs, compatibility `engine.*` APIs, serializable snapshots, and missing-token failure.
- Local available-checkout aggregate `npm run check` passed.
- Fetched ProtoKits `origin/0.0.2` is 5 commits ahead and its aggregate `test` script now adds `node tests/universal-game-domain-kits.test.mjs`; this run did not validate that fetched ref.
- New fetched commits include `Add universal game domain ProtoKit catalog`, `Add universal game domain kit test`, `Fix universal game domain catalog dedupe`, `Export universal game domain kits`, and `Add extend kit rules audit doc`.
- Compatibility shim risk remains: old injected-runtime and legacy `engine.*` APIs are intentional migration support, but no removal condition was found in this scout pass.

## Experiment proof state
- Local targeted DSK proof passes on the available Experiments checkout: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- The available Experiments checkout is clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2` by 24 commits, so this does not prove latest-ref Experiments validation.
- Local aggregate `check` still omits `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` and includes `tests/fluid-water-lab-static-smoke.mjs`.
- Fetched `origin/0.0.2` aggregate `check` still omits `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` and includes `tests/tropical-island-scene-static-smoke.mjs`.
- Fetched Experiments commits delete fluid-water-lab, add tropical-island-scene, add a local import map/fallback module, and add multiple prototype kits under the Experiments repo.
- Public proof route loads its HTML but remains human-visible stuck at `Booting...`.
- Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and `Booting...`; console output showed 404s for sibling NexusRealtime and ProtoKits module paths plus favicon.
- Local and fetched proof files still import from sibling relative paths:
  - import map maps `nexusrealtime` to `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  - `src/proof.js` imports `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  - `src/proof.js` imports ProtoKits from `../../../../NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/...`.

## Domain and kit proof coverage
- Core DSK API smoke remains green through `tests/domain-service-kit-smoke.mjs` as part of core `npm test`.
- ProtoKits first-wave service coverage is green on the local available checkout only; fetched latest-ref proof reopened because `origin/0.0.2` advanced and adds aggregate coverage not run locally.
- Experiments first-wave proof is green only as a targeted local available-checkout smoke; it is not aggregate proof, latest-ref proof, or browser-complete public proof.
- Expanded proof inventory now includes state-signal contracts alongside source-state integrity, bridge-state ownership, receipt integrity, spatial/mobility, operations data, and public distribution categories.
- Coverage categories remain separate: local command proof, latest release-ref command proof, aggregate command proof, targeted DSK command proof, raw-public file proof, CDN import proof, npm availability, and browser-complete human proof.

## Runtime ownership drift
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md`, `docs/how-to-experiment.md`, `docs/protokit-boundaries.md`, and `docs/protokit-experiment-loop.md` still keep the core/ProtoKits/Experiments split explicit.
- New reusable kit implementations should target ProtoKits by default.
- New playable/browser proofs should target Experiments by default.
- Core should stay focused on ECS/runtime/DSK/composer primitives, invariants, exports, and validation.
- Current public proof blockers do not justify moving product routes, browser proof wiring, or reusable implementation into core.
- Fetched Experiments now includes several local `protokits/*` prototype modules for tropical-island-scene; this should be treated as experiment-local proof material until reusable boundaries are extracted to ProtoKits.
- Source-state, state-signal, bridge phase, step receipt, delegated action, wrapper-state, operations, and spatial proof rows belong in runtime hardening/fixture planning before broad DSK promotion claims.

## Broken/stale proof paths
- Broken public proof paths remain:
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`
- Stale public pins remain visible in Experiments scans, including `main`, `0.0.1`, and commit-pinned CDN references in legacy routes/configs.
- Branch/package mismatch remains: release branch `0.0.2` serves core package version `0.1.0`.
- Optional npm metadata remains 404, so npm-backed consumption is not proven.
- ProtoKits and Experiments latest-ref validation are both open because fetched release refs are ahead of the local checkouts.

## Risks
- A public route returning HTTP 200 can still fail for users if module paths are not deployed.
- Aggregate validation can stay green while omitting the DSK first-wave proof smoke.
- Available-checkout targeted proof can be mistaken for latest-ref proof when sibling repos are behind fetched release refs.
- Validation commands that generate flat routes can violate scout-lane write boundaries unless run in a disposable worktree or paired with explicit cleanup policy.
- Compatibility shims can blur the difference between promoted `engine.n.*` DSK APIs and legacy `engine.*` migration APIs.
- Experiments-local prototype kits can be mistaken for reusable ProtoKits if ownership boundaries are not enforced during promotion review.
- Public consumption language can overclaim if it does not distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch availability from npm registry availability.
- DSK first-wave migration proof should not be mistaken for production-hardening proof; namespace, install, dependency, state contract, receipt, bridge, wrapper-state, source-state, state-signal, operations, and spatial gates remain open.

## Blockers
- ProtoKits must be fast-forwarded or separately validated at fetched `origin/0.0.2` before latest-ref ProtoKits proof can be claimed.
- Experiments must be fast-forwarded or separately validated at fetched `origin/0.0.2` before latest-ref Experiments proof can be claimed.
- Public proof import-map/module source strategy remains unresolved: CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or build-step import mapping.
- `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` is not wired into Experiments aggregate validation or documented as a required targeted command.
- Experiments aggregate validation still writes generated flat-route artifacts and was not run in this lane.
- npm metadata for `nexusrealtime` is unavailable.
- DSK promotion hardening lacks executable fixture coverage for state-signal contracts plus the earlier namespace, install, dependency, state, receipt, bridge, wrapper, source-state, operations, and spatial gates.

## Suggested next review item
- Validate ProtoKits and Experiments fetched `origin/0.0.2` in disposable worktrees or clean fast-forwarded checkouts, then choose the public module-loading strategy for `experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/index.html` and `src/proof.js`.
