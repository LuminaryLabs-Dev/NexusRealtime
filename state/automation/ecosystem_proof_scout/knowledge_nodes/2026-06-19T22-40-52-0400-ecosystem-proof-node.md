# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem proof scout 2026-06-19T22-40-52-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-proof-024
- statement: Core and local available-checkout DSK proof remain green, but fetched-ref and public proof are still blocked by one unresolved module-source strategy; proof-signal integrity is new proof inventory, not evidence that package resolution, browser loading, aggregate parity, npm availability, or package-version policy are fixed.
- why it matters: Promotion review must keep local checkout success, latest release-ref validation, aggregate checks, targeted DSK checks, browser-complete public proof, npm availability, package-version policy, runtime hardening, lifecycle parity, query/command semantics, experience-edge proof, read-model/orchestration proof, compatibility/content-safety proof, AR/spatial read-model proof, proof-signal integrity proof, proof taxonomy, and release evidence as separate claims.

## Child Nodes
- id: ecosystem-proof-024-a
  parent: ecosystem-proof-024
  lesson: Core still matches the preflight-resolved latest release branch and passes its smoke suite.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ahead/behind `0 0`; `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
  look further: Keep resolving latest release refs every run because sibling refs and non-release branches continue to drift.
- id: ecosystem-proof-024-b
  parent: ecosystem-proof-024
  lesson: ProtoKits local available-checkout proof is green, but fetched latest-ref aggregate and targeted DSK proof remain blocked by package resolution.
  evidence: Local ProtoKits `npm run check` and `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed at `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`; fetched `origin/0.0.2` remains `f0fa45a75eea2c4b88683fe3bf146b0453812820` with local ahead/behind `0 26`; disposable fetched-ref check scanned 311 JavaScript modules and failed with 110 import failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`; targeted DSK smoke failed for the same package.
  look further: Validate fetched ProtoKits with a package, workspace, CDN, or link model that matches intended consumption.
- id: ecosystem-proof-024-c
  parent: ecosystem-proof-024
  lesson: Experiments fetched-ref aggregate check can pass while targeted DSK proof still fails.
  evidence: Disposable Experiments `origin/0.0.2` at `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb` passed `npm run check`; targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed because `src/proof.js` resolved `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js` to missing `/private/tmp/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  look further: Wire the DSK smoke into aggregate validation or document the required sibling/module setup.
- id: ecosystem-proof-024-d
  parent: ecosystem-proof-024
  lesson: Public DSK proof remains HTTP-visible but browser-stuck at `Booting...`.
  evidence: Curl returned 200 for the route; Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof` plus `Booting...`; console/request output showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.
  look further: Do not treat HTTP 200 on the route as browser-complete proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-024-e
  parent: ecosystem-proof-024
  lesson: The same unresolved module-source strategy blocks fetched-ref and public proof surfaces.
  evidence: ProtoKits failed on package-name `nexusrealtime`; Experiments targeted proof failed on missing sibling `NexusRealtime`; public route failed on deployed sibling module 404s.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, workspace/package dependency, or a build-step import map.
- id: ecosystem-proof-024-f
  parent: ecosystem-proof-024
  lesson: Fetched Experiments aggregate proof reflects tropical-island-scene but still omits DSK first-wave proof.
  evidence: Fetched aggregate output includes `tests/tropical-island-scene-static-smoke.mjs`; local `package.json` includes `tests/fluid-water-lab-static-smoke.mjs`; neither local nor fetched aggregate `check` script lists `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
  look further: Keep aggregate proof and targeted DSK proof distinct until the script or release checklist makes the DSK smoke explicit.
- id: ecosystem-proof-024-g
  parent: ecosystem-proof-024
  lesson: Proof-signal integrity is important evidence-quality inventory but not distribution proof.
  evidence: Deep bug node `2026-06-19T21-55-21-0400`, domain idea node `2026-06-19T22-01-38-0400`, ecosystem state node `2026-06-19T22-10-08-0400`, and DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T22-25-35-0400` add ARExperience terminal receipt idempotency, WebXR hit-test source failure policy, monotonic normal tick time, and finite spatial scale rows while live proof evidence still shows package/sibling/browser module-resolution failures.
  look further: Route proof-signal integrity rows into executable fixtures separately from public module-source and fetched-ref validation work.
- id: ecosystem-proof-024-h
  parent: ecosystem-proof-024
  lesson: Core/ProtoKits/Experiments ownership docs still point reusable implementation to ProtoKits and browser proof routing to Experiments.
  evidence: `docs/how-to-protokit.md`, `docs/how-to-experiment.md`, `docs/protokit-boundaries.md`, and `docs/protokit-experiment-loop.md` keep core as runtime/DSK/composer owner, ProtoKits as reusable implementation owner, and Experiments as playable/browser proof owner.
  look further: Fix proof routing/imports without moving route ownership, reusable implementation, or proof-readiness checklist tooling into NexusRealtime core.
