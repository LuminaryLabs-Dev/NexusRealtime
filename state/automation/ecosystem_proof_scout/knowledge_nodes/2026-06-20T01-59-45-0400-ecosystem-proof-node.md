# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem proof scout 2026-06-20T01-59-45-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-proof-025
- statement: Core still matches the preflight-resolved latest release branch and passes smoke tests, but first-wave DSK ecosystem proof is now blocked earlier: ProtoKits local/fetched checks and Experiments local targeted proof cannot resolve package `nexusrealtime`, while fetched Experiments targeted proof and public browser proof still fail on sibling module paths.
- why it matters: The promotion review can no longer describe local available-checkout DSK proof as green. The active blocker is a shared module-source/package-resolution strategy that must cover local sibling checkouts, disposable release refs, aggregate-vs-targeted validation, and public browser loading.

## Child Nodes
- id: ecosystem-proof-025-a
  parent: ecosystem-proof-025
  lesson: Core still matches the preflight-resolved latest release branch and passes its smoke suite.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ahead/behind `0 0`; `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
  look further: Keep resolving latest release refs every run because sibling refs and non-release branches continue to drift.
- id: ecosystem-proof-025-b
  parent: ecosystem-proof-025
  lesson: ProtoKits local available-checkout proof is no longer green because the direct-import DSK adapter cannot resolve package `nexusrealtime`.
  evidence: Local ProtoKits `npm run check` failed after checking 330 JavaScript modules with 110 import smoke failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`; local `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` failed on the same package import; local branch `0.0.2` is behind final fetched `origin/0.0.2` by 31 commits.
  look further: Validate ProtoKits with an explicit package, workspace, CDN, or link model that matches intended consumption.
- id: ecosystem-proof-025-c
  parent: ecosystem-proof-025
  lesson: ProtoKits fetched latest-ref proof remains blocked by the same package-resolution model, and the release ref moved during the run.
  evidence: Final fetched ProtoKits `origin/0.0.2` was `b1d69099392a144a999cac824d344c403fe762d8`; disposable fetched-ref `npm run check` failed after checking 358 JavaScript modules with 110 missing-package import failures; targeted DSK smoke failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
  look further: Record exact fetched refs in proof packets and retry only after module-source policy is chosen.
- id: ecosystem-proof-025-d
  parent: ecosystem-proof-025
  lesson: Experiments aggregate proof can pass at fetched ref while local and fetched targeted DSK proof remain blocked.
  evidence: Local Experiments targeted DSK smoke failed because sibling ProtoKits could not resolve package `nexusrealtime`; disposable fetched Experiments `origin/0.0.2` at `eaeec53bc44e13136e18af37ed4c3f0755b57e60` passed `npm run check`, but targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed because `src/proof.js` resolved `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js` to missing `/private/tmp/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  look further: Wire the DSK smoke into aggregate validation or document the required sibling/module setup after module-source policy is fixed.
- id: ecosystem-proof-025-e
  parent: ecosystem-proof-025
  lesson: Public DSK proof remains HTTP-visible but browser-stuck at `Booting...`.
  evidence: Curl returned 200 for the route; Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and `Booting...`; console/request output showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.
  look further: Do not treat HTTP 200 on the route as browser-complete proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-025-f
  parent: ecosystem-proof-025
  lesson: The same unresolved module-source strategy now blocks all DSK proof surfaces except core smoke.
  evidence: ProtoKits fails on package-name `nexusrealtime`; local Experiments fails through ProtoKits package resolution; fetched Experiments targeted proof fails on missing sibling `NexusRealtime`; public route fails on deployed sibling module 404s; npm metadata remains optional 404.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, workspace/package dependency, or a build-step import map as one policy rather than repairing each surface separately.
- id: ecosystem-proof-025-g
  parent: ecosystem-proof-025
  lesson: Proof-signal integrity and AR/spatial hardening remain important proof inventory but are not evidence that distribution proof is fixed.
  evidence: DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T22-25-35-0400`, deep bug node `2026-06-19T21-55-21-0400`, and domain idea node `2026-06-20T00-00-47-0400` keep proof-signal integrity, AR/spatial rows, module-source gates, package-version policy, and aggregate-targeted parity separate.
  look further: Route proof-signal rows into executable fixtures separately from public module-source and fetched-ref validation work.
- id: ecosystem-proof-025-h
  parent: ecosystem-proof-025
  lesson: Core/ProtoKits/Experiments ownership boundaries still hold despite the package-resolution blocker.
  evidence: Repo memory and boundary docs keep core as runtime/DSK/composer owner, ProtoKits as reusable implementation owner, and Experiments as playable/browser proof owner; this run found no reason to move proof routing or reusable implementation into NexusRealtime core.
  look further: Fix proof routing/imports without moving route ownership, reusable implementation, or proof-readiness checklist tooling into NexusRealtime core.
