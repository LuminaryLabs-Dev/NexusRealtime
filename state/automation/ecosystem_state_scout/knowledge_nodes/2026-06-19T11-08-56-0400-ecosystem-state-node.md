# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem_state_scout 2026-06-19T11-08-56-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-root-013
- statement: Core and ProtoKits remain latest-ref aligned and validation-green, but Experiments latest release ref advanced again and is now 24 commits ahead of the clean local checkout; public browser proof still stalls on missing module paths; aggregate DSK smoke coverage still omits the targeted proof; npm/package policy and DSK hardening gates remain unresolved.
- why it matters: Promotion review must keep core/ProtoKits command proof separate from Experiments latest-ref proof, browser-complete public proof, aggregate proof, public distribution proof, and runtime hardening proof.

## Child Nodes
- id: core-and-protokits-still-aligned-2026-06-19-1108
  parent: ecosystem-root-013
  lesson: Core and ProtoKits still match the preflight-resolved latest release branch and pass available validation.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ProtoKits `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`; core `npm test`, ProtoKits `npm run check`, and ProtoKits `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed.
  look further: Keep resolving latest release refs each run because sibling refs have drifted repeatedly.
- id: experiments-latest-ref-drift-2026-06-19-1108
  parent: ecosystem-root-013
  lesson: Experiments available checkout is clean and targeted DSK proof passes, but fetched `origin/0.0.2` advanced again and is now 24 commits ahead.
  evidence: Experiments local `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f` and origin `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb` showed ahead/behind `0 24`; `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed on the available checkout.
  look further: Validate Experiments at fetched `origin/0.0.2` in a disposable worktree or fast-forwarded clean checkout.
- id: public-proof-import-shape-2026-06-19-1108
  parent: ecosystem-root-013
  lesson: The public DSK proof route remains HTTP-visible but browser-stuck at `Booting...`.
  evidence: Playwright snapshot and screenshot for `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/` showed `Booting...`; console and curl checks showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, `NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`, and `NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or a build-step import map for the public proof route.
- id: aggregate-dsk-proof-validation-2026-06-19-1108
  parent: ecosystem-root-013
  lesson: Experiments aggregate validation still omits the DSK first-wave smoke, and default aggregate checks remain write-producing.
  evidence: Local and fetched Experiments `package.json` `check` scripts do not list `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`; both start with `npm run generate:flat-routes`; the targeted smoke passed separately.
  look further: Add the DSK smoke to an aggregate check, document it as required targeted release evidence, or run aggregate validation in a disposable worktree.
- id: generated-route-validation-boundary-2026-06-19-1108
  parent: ecosystem-root-013
  lesson: Experiments aggregate validation should stay out of scout main-checkout runs until route generation is idempotent or disposable validation is standard.
  evidence: Experiments `package.json` `check` starts with `npm run generate:flat-routes`; prior packets observed generated route dirt; this run left Experiments clean by running only the targeted DSK smoke.
  look further: Make route generation idempotent, add cleanup policy, or validate aggregate checks in a disposable worktree.
- id: source-state-hardening-2026-06-19-1108
  parent: ecosystem-root-013
  lesson: Source-state integrity remains a DSK hardening gate separate from public proof loading.
  evidence: DSK architecture and prior ecosystem state nodes keep authored-source isolation, reset-source guarantees, retention-limit normalization, and initial terminal-state receipts in promotion gates.
  look further: Add source/reset/retention/initial-terminal proof rows before dataset-heavy, ledger, pressure, replay, or proof services are promoted broadly.
- id: state-signal-contract-hardening-2026-06-19-1108
  parent: ecosystem-root-013
  lesson: State signal contracts remain DSK promotion gates: descriptor invalidation, action repeat policy, transition receipts, coordinate-axis policy, and derived-state boundaries.
  evidence: Deep bug node `2026-06-19T09-54-20-0400` found route-aware placement, held interaction, puzzle/combat transition, scenario-driver axis, and camera-derived-state gaps; domain idea node `2026-06-19T10-02-21-0400` maps them into state signal contract proof rows.
  look further: Add invalidation/action/transition/coordinate/derived-state rows before placement, interaction, puzzle/combat, validation-driver, or camera services are promoted.
- id: public-consumption-npm-gap-2026-06-19-1108
  parent: ecosystem-root-013
  lesson: GitHub/raw/jsDelivr consumption remains reachable while npm package metadata still returns 404.
  evidence: `npm run automation:preflight` returned 200 for required GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links and 404 for `https://registry.npmjs.org/nexusrealtime`.
  look further: `README.md`, `package.json`, npm publication policy, and public consumption wording.
- id: package-version-policy-2026-06-19-1108
  parent: ecosystem-root-013
  lesson: Release branch `0.0.2` still serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.
  evidence: Local and raw public package metadata report `nexusrealtime@0.1.0`; preflight confirmed raw public `0.0.2/package.json` is reachable.
  look further: Branch naming policy, package version policy, and README release wording.
- id: dsk-hardening-proof-gates-2026-06-19-1108
  parent: ecosystem-root-013
  lesson: DSK promotion gates remain broader than branch alignment, local targeted proof, aggregate validation, and public module loading.
  evidence: Neighboring architecture, proof, bug, and idea nodes keep namespace, install, dependency, state-contract, service-call, operations, spatial/mobility, receipt, bridge, source-state, and state-signal fixtures open.
  look further: Keep public proof loading fixes separate from DSK production-hardening fixture plans.
