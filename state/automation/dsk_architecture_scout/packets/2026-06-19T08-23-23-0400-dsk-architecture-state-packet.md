# DSK Architecture State Packet

## Timestamp
- 2026-06-19T08-23-23-0400

## Lane Goal
- Audit DSK architecture, contracts, invariants, scaling, and promotion risk for long-term NexusRealtime production viability.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `dsk-receipt-integrity-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0724`.
- Latest DSK packet `2026-06-19T07-24-53-0400` kept core release-aligned and test-green, but added receipt identity, event idempotency, claim policy, and request identity to the DSK promotion fixture gates.
- Latest ecosystem state packet `2026-06-19T08-13-48-0400` says core, ProtoKits, and Experiments remain aligned and validation-green, while public browser proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy, and DSK hardening gates remain open.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet `2026-06-19T07-42-18-0400` says local latest-ref proof is green but public browser proof still stalls at `Booting...`.
- Latest deep bug packet `2026-06-19T07-53-41-0400` adds bridge and wrapper-state gaps: SurfacePlacement raw AR events miss ObjectiveFlow, ObjectiveFlow/ARExperience step receipts do not emit on one-step completion, and several wrapper APIs delegate actions without updating their own advertised state.
- Latest domain idea packet `2026-06-19T08-00-55-0400` converts those bugs into bridge phase, step transition receipt, delegated-action reconciliation, wrapper state contract, and bridge-state proof inventory.
- These packets are context only. Live source, tests, docs, preflight, git refs, and focused probes are authority for this run.

- `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`
  - Result: both refs resolve to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`.
- `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2`

  - Result before this packet: no source/test/runtime diff; pre-existing tracked diffs in expansion docs and this lane tracker.
- `npm test`
  - Result: pass, 8 smoke tests.
- Focused `node --input-type=module` DSK/bridge/wrapper probe
  - Result: confirmed reserved `apiName:"__proto__"` is not an own namespace key, failed API collision leaves `n-late-collision-kit` in `engine.kits` and `engine.domainServiceKits`, direct DSK install allows missing `runtime:needed`, raw AR anchor bridge does not advance ObjectiveFlow, one-step ObjectiveFlow/ARExperience final completion emits no step receipt batch, and SymbolAlignment delegates completion while its own `aligned` state remains `0`.
- One discarded focused probe attempt
  - Result: failed because event surfaces expose `snapshot()`, not `getEvents()`; rerun above used the correct API.

## DSK contract state
- `defineRuntimeKit()` remains the low-level installable primitive for components, resources, events, systems, bindings, registries, sequences, sequence nodes, metadata, and install hooks.
- `defineDomainServiceKit()` still wraps runtime kits with required domain/stability/version metadata, default `n-<domain>-kit` ids, `n:` capability tokens, optional service tokens, and `engine.n.<apiName>` installation.
- `src/index.js` exports the DSK surface plus the bridge, objective, AR, interaction, puzzle-wrapper, timing, collectible, and request kits now relevant to promotion fixtures.
- DSK execution remains normal runtime-kit install plus linear scheduler phases. `asyncReady`, `snapshot`, `reset`, and `serializableState` are metadata/convention today, not enforced runtime boundaries.
- `createGameKitComposer()` enforces all `requires` tokens during composition. Direct `installRuntimeKit()` still only rejects missing DSK requirements whose tokens start with `n:`.
- No live source drift was found that resolves prior namespace, install atomicity, dependency parity, state contract, receipt, or bridge-state blockers on current `origin/0.0.2`.

## Invariant coverage
- Covered by current smoke/freeze tests:
  - default DSK id/token metadata and public exports
  - normal `engine.n.<api>` install path
  - missing direct `n:` dependency rejection
  - simple JSON-serializable snapshot happy path
  - same-object duplicate install no-op
  - same-id duplicate DSK rejection
  - normal API collision throws
  - simple extension duplicate resource/system checks
- Still not covered:
  - reserved `apiName` keys and own-property namespace guarantees
  - rollback after failed install stages
  - direct install parity or documented divergence for non-`n:` requirements
  - duplicate provider-token diagnostics across different DSK ids
  - reset/snapshot absence, failure, non-serializable state, restore, and reset policy
  - async metadata override behavior and async boundary expectations
  - accepted/rejected service-call receipts before side effects
  - receipt identity, event idempotency, claim idempotency, and generated request ids
  - bridge phase policy for events emitted after consumers
  - one-step and final-step transition receipts
  - wrapper-owned state versus delegated stateless adapter declarations
  - public browser proof completion and aggregate DSK smoke coverage

## Domain and kit expansion architecture notes
- Expansion docs remain planning inventory, not release contract.
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md` still keeps new reusable implementations in ProtoKits by default; core should change only for runtime/DSK/composer primitives, invariants, and validation surfaces.
- The latest neighboring domain idea inventory adds `bridge-state-ownership` on top of receipt integrity. That does not justify promoting wrapper kits into core; it does justify adding bridge/state proof rows before AR, lesson, puzzle, or platformer DSK promotion.
- Bridge work should distinguish three policies: same-tick consumer, persistent next-tick event queue, or direct service call. SurfacePlacement currently has both direct API bridging and raw-event bridging, but the raw event path is not equivalent.
- Wrapper APIs need an explicit state contract: own state and mutate it, mirror delegated InteractionTarget state, or declare themselves stateless adapters that should not advertise authoritative progress fields.
- Public proof remains separate from DSK hardening; a browser-visible route can still be stuck at `Booting...` even when local targeted proof is green.

## Scaling risks
- `installRuntimeKit()` rebuilds installed provides from `engine.kits.flatMap(...)` for each DSK install; acceptable at smoke scale, weak for larger provider graphs.
- `createGameKitComposer()` repeatedly scans pending kits until dependencies resolve, trending quadratically with larger kit counts.
- `engine.n` is a flat normal object, so broad DSK promotion increases collision, inherited-key, reserved-key, discoverability, and ownership risks.
- Direct-install dependency behavior differs from composer behavior, creating different outcomes for the same graph depending on entry path.
- Metadata-only reset/snapshot/async claims are insufficient for replay, restore, worker, network, or long-lived engine promotion.
- Cross-domain event bridges can be structurally valid but phase-lost if emitted after their consumers run.
- Wrapper services can look promoted while actually delegating mutation elsewhere and leaving their own snapshots stale.

## Bug candidates
- Confirmed: reserved namespace API key. Probe result for `apiName:"__proto__"`: `protoOwn:false`, `protoKeys:[]`, `protoMarker:"__proto__-api"`.
- Confirmed: failed API collision install is non-atomic. Probe result after collision: thrown error plus `engine.kits` and `engine.domainServiceKits` both contain `n-late-collision-kit`.
- Confirmed/design gap: direct DSK install allows a missing non-`n:` requirement. Probe result: `n-generic-dependent-kit` installs with `requires:["runtime:needed"]`.
- Confirmed: SurfacePlacement raw AR anchor bridge emits after ObjectiveFlow's `simulate` consumer and does not advance ObjectiveFlow. Probe result: first and second tick both keep `completed:false`, `progress:0`.
- Confirmed: one-step ObjectiveFlow and ARExperience completions emit final completion batches but no step-completion batches. Probe result: `objectiveStepBatches:0`, `objectiveCompletionBatches:1`, `arStepBatches:0`, `arCompletionBatches:1`.
- Confirmed: SymbolAlignment wrapper delegates to InteractionTarget while its own state remains unchanged. Probe result: `targetComplete:true`, `beforeAligned:0`, `returnedAligned:0`, `afterAligned:0`.
- Candidate: the smallest DSK promotion plan now needs bridge phase and wrapper-state rows in addition to install, receipt, spatial/mobility, operations, and service-call rows.

## Missing tests
- Reserved `apiName` handling for `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`.
- Own-property assertions for every installed `engine.n` API.
- Failed install rollback after API collision, `initWorld` throw, registry throw, scheduler add throw, sequence runtime throw, sequence node runtime throw, and install hook throw.
- Direct install parity or documented divergence for non-`n:` `requires` tokens.
- Duplicate provider-token diagnostics across different DSK ids.
- End-to-end `extendDomainServiceKit()` install behavior.
- Reset/snapshot absence, failure, non-serializable state, restore, and reset policy coverage.
- Async metadata override tests that explicitly state async is metadata-only today.
- Receipt identity, idempotent completion events, idempotent claim events, and generated request identity fixtures.
- Bridge phase fixture for `SurfacePlacementKit` raw AR events reaching ObjectiveFlow.
- ObjectiveFlow and ARExperience step-transition receipt fixtures for one-step, middle-step, final-step, reset, and duplicate-attempt cases.
- Delegated wrapper reconciliation fixtures for symbol alignment, lock/socket, reveal light, sorting, moving target, and micro-platformer APIs.
- Wrapper state contract fixtures that distinguish owned state, mirrored state, and intentionally stateless adapters.

## Promotion risks
- Do not promote broad ProtoKit or domain idea graphs into core until namespace safety, install atomicity, dependency policy, state contract enforcement, service-call policy, receipt integrity, bridge phase, and wrapper-state contracts are designed and tested.
- Do not claim async DSK execution, worker readiness, network partitioning, or replay/restore support from current metadata.
- Do not claim raw event bridges are equivalent to direct service calls until phase delivery is proven.
- Do not claim wrapper state is authoritative when actions delegate to InteractionTarget and leave wrapper resources unchanged.
- Do not claim npm package availability; optional npm metadata remains 404.
- Do not treat public route HTTP 200 as working browser proof; neighboring lanes still report `Booting...`.
- Do not treat local aggregate validation as DSK first-wave proof unless the targeted DSK smoke is included or explicitly required.
- Do not treat idea docs as canonical public architecture.

## Suggested next review item
- Use a non-scout lane to write the smallest executable DSK promotion hardening fixture set:
  - `engine.n` namespace policy
  - install preflight/rollback transaction boundaries
  - direct-install dependency parity versus composer-only policy
  - minimal reset/snapshot/serialization contract
  - receipt identity and event/claim idempotency
  - bridge phase delivery and step-transition receipts
  - delegated wrapper state reconciliation or stateless adapter declarations
  - operations data and spatial/mobility invariant rows

## Not claimed
- No bugs were fixed.
- No source, tests, docs, examples, package metadata, repo memory, public claims, `.agent` files, ProtoKits, Experiments, or deployments were edited.
- Passing `npm test` does not prove production DSK readiness.
- This packet does not prove browser UX, public proof completion, npm publication, async execution, worker/network readiness, or broad domain graph promotion.
