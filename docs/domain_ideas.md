# Domain Ideas

This file is an expansion inventory for NexusRealtime DSK planning. It is not an implementation ledger. Add domain ideas here when a composition suggests a reusable ownership boundary that could become a Domain Service Kit.

Implementation target: when a domain idea becomes a real reusable kit, create or refine it in `/Users/crimsonwheeler/Documents/GitHub/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/`. NexusRealtime core should only receive contract, runtime, composer, or validation changes that make domain kits safer to compose.

## Domain Idea Rules

- A domain owns a state boundary, lifecycle, and service contract.
- A domain can be any scale: fish tank, room, route, city, open world, AR session, or replicated simulation slice.
- A domain should expose bridge services through `engine.n.*`, not by sharing private resources.
- A domain should be reusable across multiple products through config, datasets, and composition.
- A domain should declare likely `provides`, `requires`, snapshot/reset expectations, and path ownership.
- Treat domain ideas as ProtoKit candidates by default, not core kit requests.

- `n:ar:mode-selection-policy`
- `n:ar:launch-state-isolation`
- `n:spatial-room:getter-isolation`
- `n:proof:ar-spatial-read-model`

Fits:

- AR launch runtimes where a host must have installed required AR resources before mode startup can call `engine.ar`
- capability selectors where explicit preferred modes should either be honored, rejected, or labeled as fallback instead of silently becoming preview proof
- AR launch render/update callbacks where support, placement, objective, interaction, collectible, or render descriptor state must be snapshots instead of live mutation handles
- SpatialRoom and building descriptor services where read-named getters must not expose mutable building, room, or anchor objects to renderers and proof panels
- proof harnesses that need AR/spatial capability and read-model rows separate from public module-source loading, AR DOM text safety, and general query snapshot isolation

## 36. Proof Signal Integrity Domain

Purpose: owns receipt idempotency, nullable device helper failure policy, monotonic tick time, finite spatial config, and proof rows where runtime proof signals must be one-shot, forward-time, non-throwing, and finite before telemetry, tutorials, AR flows, or DSK reviews can trust them.

Possible services:

- `n:proof-signal:integrity`
- `n:experience:terminal-receipts`
- `n:webxr:hit-test-failure`
- `n:time:monotonic-tick`
- `n:spatial:finite-scale`
- `n:proof:signal-integrity`

Fits:

- AR experience services where terminal completion events should be edge-triggered receipts instead of persistent-state emissions on every later tick
- browser/device helpers where unavailable or denied hit-test setup should return nullable or structured unsupported results instead of escaping through mode startup
- engine, scheduler, sequence, duration, and telemetry services where normal ticks must not publish negative elapsed time unless a separate replay API owns rewind semantics
- greybox, SpatialRoom, AR anchor, and render descriptor services where scale and geometry inputs must become finite, bounded values before proof panels or renderers consume them
- proof harnesses that need receipt counts, device degraded states, time policy, and finite geometry rows separate from public module-source proof and AR launch read-model proof

## 37. Composition Proof Ownership Domain

Purpose: owns capability provider ownership, SequenceNode type registration policy, event-history read-model isolation, AR runtime-source consistency, and proof rows where composed DSK graphs can appear valid while provider, orchestration, history, or device-source ownership is ambiguous.

Possible services:

- `n:composition-proof:ownership`
- `n:composition:provider-ownership`
- `n:sequence:type-registry-policy`
- `n:sequence:event-history-isolation`
- `n:ar:runtime-source-consistency`
- `n:proof:composition-ownership`

Fits:

- composer and DSK graphs where duplicate capability providers must reject, namespace, or declare intentional override ownership before capability presence counts as proof
- SequenceNode-backed kits where duplicate type names must reject or explicitly override before runtime plans can trust type semantics
- SequenceNode event buses, diagnostics, telemetry, and proof panels where history snapshots must not expose mutable event objects
- AR launch and browser/device proof harnesses where support classification and selected mode startup must use one runtime source or reconcile failed startup state
- proof harnesses that need provider ownership, type registry, event history, and AR runtime-source rows separate from distribution proof, proof-signal integrity, and base runtime failure-boundary work

## 38. Runtime Identity And Lifecycle Ownership Domain

Purpose: owns runtime binding ownership, ECS definition identity, SequenceNode install-only kit idempotency, event-bus disposed parity, and proof rows where composed graphs can silently share names, replay side effects, or mutate listener state after teardown.

Possible services:

- `n:runtime-identity:lifecycle-ownership`
- `n:runtime:binding-ownership`
- `n:ecs:definition-identity`
- `n:sequence:install-only-idempotency`
- `n:sequence:event-bus-disposed-parity`
- `n:proof:runtime-identity-lifecycle`

Fits:

- runtime kit and composer graphs where duplicate binding names must reject, namespace, or declare intentional override ownership before bindings count as service proof
- ECS-backed domain kits where same-named components, resources, and events must be intentionally shared or diagnosed before state isolation claims are trusted
- SequenceNode-backed proof graphs where raw install-only adapters must be recorded or normalized so repeated deployments do not replay global side effects
- SequenceNode event buses where every listener API must share disposed-state policy before lifecycle cleanup proof can trust listener counts
- proof harnesses that need binding, definition identity, install idempotency, and disposed-listener rows separate from capability provider ownership, public module-source proof, and base runtime failure-boundary work

## 39. Content Boundary And Objective Contract Domain

Purpose: owns public API product-boundary checks, preset/runtime identity policy, objective threshold semantics, content dataset validation, and proof rows where content-driven kits can appear complete or reusable while leaking themed presets, sharing ids, or accepting invalid authored criteria.

Possible services:

- `n:content-boundary:objective-contract`
- `n:public-api:product-boundary`
- `n:kit:preset-identity`
- `n:objective:threshold-policy`
- `n:content:dataset-validation`
- `n:proof:content-boundary-objective`

Fits:

- public core exports where authored product/theme presets should be absent, deprecated, or explicitly marked compatibility-only before core boundary claims are trusted
- content kit factories where caller-provided ids, preset ids, and installed metadata must be honored, rejected, or diagnosed before multiple variants compose
- objective and scenario services where zero, negative, missing, malformed, or disabled targets must have explicit semantics instead of completing proof state by accident
- content-driven domains where species, lures, objectives, duplicate ids, unknown ids, disabled content, and generated entities need one validation/diagnostic path
- proof harnesses that need public API boundary, kit identity, objective policy, and dataset contract rows separate from generic runtime identity, content-dataset placeholders, and public module-source proof

## 40. Query Read Model Isolation Domain

Purpose: owns public query helper outputs, engine read-method snapshots, nested metadata isolation, stored query snapshots, and proof rows where read-only APIs can mutate runtime or caller-owned state through returned objects.

Possible services:

- `n:query-read-model:isolation`
- `n:query:helper-contract`
- `n:engine-read:snapshot-contract`
- `n:metadata:read-isolation`
- `n:stored-query:proof-snapshot`
- `n:proof:query-read-model-isolation`

Fits:

- request, cargo, route, guidance, affordance, hazard, water, and inspection services where `query*`, `nearest*`, `available*`, or collision APIs must return isolated read models
- metadata-heavy authored datasets where shallow top-level clones still expose nested mutable metadata or hazard descriptors
- runtime states with `lastQuery`, `lastCollision`, or similar audit fields that must store proof snapshots rather than aliases to returned objects
- renderers, telemetry, AI adapters, dashboards, and proof harnesses that should inspect query output without becoming mutation paths
- DSK hardening fixtures that need query read-model isolation separate from command rejection, proximity transition side effects, source-config isolation, surface snapshots, and public module-source proof

## 41. Scheduler World Mutation Isolation Domain

Purpose: owns scheduler active-run topology policy, phase mutation boundaries, ECS system iteration membership semantics, low-level event queue payload isolation, and proof rows where one tick can change execution shape or mutate queued evidence while appearing deterministic.

Possible services:

- `n:scheduler-world:mutation-isolation`
- `n:scheduler:active-run-policy`
- `n:scheduler:phase-topology`
- `n:runsystem:membership-snapshot`
- `n:event-queue:payload-isolation`
- `n:proof:scheduler-world-mutation`

Fits:

- ECS scheduler runs where systems or phases added during an active pass must reject, defer to the next pass, or be explicitly documented as immediate
- DSK installers, runtime kits, and proof adapters that attach systems during runtime and need deterministic same-tick ordering
- cleanup, despawn, transfer, collision, and objective systems where `runSystem()` must either skip removed entities or provide stable component snapshots
- SequenceNode bridges, diagnostics, telemetry, and proof probes that inspect queued events without mutating payloads before later systems read them
- DSK hardening fixtures that need scheduler/world mutation isolation below query read models, surface snapshots, runtime identity, and public module-source proof

## 42. Procedural Navigation State Ownership Domain

Purpose: owns navigation command payload isolation, navigation proof snapshot isolation, procedural proof snapshot isolation, procedural command return-state policy, and proof rows where generated space and pathfinding can appear deterministic while callers mutate queued requests or live snapshots.

Possible services:

- `n:procedural-navigation:state-ownership`
- `n:navigation:command-payload-ownership`
- `n:navigation:proof-snapshot-isolation`
- `n:procedural:proof-snapshot-isolation`
- `n:procedural:command-return-state`
- `n:proof:procedural-navigation-ownership`

Fits:

- navigation command APIs where caller-owned `start` or `goal` objects must be cloned, frozen, or explicitly treated as mutable handles before queued path work can count as replay-safe
- navigation read APIs where path history, `lastPath`, request queues, debug graphs, and agent path arrays must return proof snapshots instead of live runtime resources
- procedural generation services where cells, walkability, regions, render descriptors, objective markers, and world positions must not be mutable through read-only snapshot calls
- procedural regeneration commands where returned state must be an isolated summary or documented handle so callers cannot cancel, retarget, or dirty pending generation by mutating a return value
- DSK hardening fixtures that need procedural/navigation ownership rows separate from traversal cost policy, procedural signature taxonomy, query read-model isolation, scheduler/world mutation, and public module-source proof

## 43. Telemetry Command Evidence Ownership Domain

Purpose: owns telemetry selected-value snapshots, telemetry path selector isolation, service command payload ownership, submitted input frame ownership, and returned command state policy where proof records or command APIs can retain caller-owned objects while looking like replay-safe evidence.

Possible services:

- `n:telemetry-command:evidence-ownership`
- `n:telemetry:selected-value-snapshot`
- `n:telemetry:path-selector-isolation`
- `n:service-command:payload-ownership`
- `n:input-frame:ownership`
- `n:proof:telemetry-command-evidence`

Fits:

- telemetry services where selected resources, nested selector paths, manual snapshots, cleanup snapshots, and history entries must be cloned or frozen before they count as proof
- queue, transport, request, operations, and service-flow commands where caller-owned metadata, reward, penalty, or payload objects must not mutate queued work after submission
- input and replay services where submitted input metadata must become an immutable frame rather than a live host object or returned mutable state
- command methods that return state summaries and need explicit snapshot versus mutable-handle semantics before automation, SequenceNode, or dashboards inspect them
- DSK hardening fixtures that need telemetry and command evidence ownership separate from public query read models, procedural/navigation ownership, low-level event queue isolation, and public module-source proof
