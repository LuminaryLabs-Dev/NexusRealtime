# Ecosystem Proof State Packet

Timestamp: 2026-06-20T18:41:30-0400
Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem Proof State Packet
Scope: NexusRealtime core, NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, NexusRealtime-Experiments
Result: partial; core remains latest-release aligned and smoke-green, Experiments latest-ref aggregate is green, but DSK ecosystem proof is still blocked by module-source strategy and the available ProtoKits checkout has drifted back to `main`/`0.0.1` instead of the preflight-resolved release branch.

## Lane Goal
- Audit proof coverage across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, public routes, and DSK expansion ideas.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `ecosystem-proof-030`.
- Latest proof packet/node `2026-06-20T06-40-01-0400` kept the active blocker on module-source strategy: ProtoKits local/latest-ref checks could not resolve package `nexusrealtime`, Experiments targeted proof failed through package/sibling paths, fetched Experiments aggregate passed, and public browser proof stayed at `Booting...`.
- Latest ecosystem state packet/node `2026-06-20T18-11-35-0400` confirmed core and ProtoKits release-ref proof still split around module-source strategy, while procedural/navigation and telemetry/command ownership are hardening inventory rather than distribution proof fixes.
- Latest DSK architecture packet/node `2026-06-20T18-23-40-0400` added Telemetry Command Evidence Ownership as a separate DSK hardening row.
- Latest deep bug packet/node `2026-06-20T17-54-14-0400` found telemetry snapshot, RequestQueue, TransportRoute, and InputIntent payload/state ownership bugs.
- Latest domain idea packet/node `2026-06-20T18-00-21-0400` mapped those bugs into Telemetry Command Evidence Ownership planning inventory.
- State packets were context only. Live source, docs, tests, git refs, public URLs, preflight, fetched-ref extractions, and Playwright launch state were authority for this run.

## Commands run
- NexusRealtime: `npm run automation:preflight` -> passed; latest branch `0.0.2`; required GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links OK; optional npm metadata 404.
- NexusRealtime: `npm test` -> passed 8 smoke tests.
- NexusRealtime/ProtoKits/Experiments: `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`, `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2`, package metadata checks.
- ProtoKits available checkout: `npm run check` -> passed for `@luminarylabs/nexusrealtime-protokits@0.0.1`; syntax checked 239 modules, imported 189 ProtoKit index modules, and completed the listed test chain.
- ProtoKits available checkout: `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` was not runnable because the file is absent on local `main`.
- ProtoKits fetched `origin/0.0.2` disposable extraction: package metadata `@luminarylabs/nexusrealtime-protokits@0.0.2`; `npm run check` syntax checked 386 modules, then failed 111 import smokes rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime` from `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js`.
- ProtoKits fetched `origin/0.0.2` targeted DSK smoke: `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` -> failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments available/latest-ref checkout: `npm run check` -> passed; generated 100 flat route wrappers and passed the aggregate smoke chain.
- Experiments available/latest-ref targeted DSK smoke: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` -> failed against local sibling ProtoKits `main` because `domain-service-kits/index.js` does not export `createNCompletionLedgerKit`.
- Experiments fetched `origin/0.0.2` disposable extraction: `npm run check` -> passed; targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` -> failed because `experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/src/proof.js` imports `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, resolving to missing `/private/tmp/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
- Public URL checks used Node `fetch`.
- Human-view validation used Playwright CLI. Mandatory question: Have I checked what the human would actually see, and do I need screenshots, visual inspection, launch-state inspection, or before/after comparison to validate this properly? Answer: yes; launch-state inspection was required. Snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and visible `Booting...`; console/request output showed 404s for sibling NexusRealtime and ProtoKits module paths. Generated `.playwright-cli` scratch files were removed.

## ProtoKits migration state
- Available local ProtoKits is no longer on the release branch: it is `main`/`0.0.1`, 251 commits behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`.
- Local `main` aggregate checks pass, but that only proves the older available checkout; it does not prove first-wave DSK release readiness because `tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` is absent locally.
- Fetched `origin/0.0.2` contains `docs/DSK-FIRST-WAVE-LEDGER.md`, `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js`, `protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`, `protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`, and `tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs`.
- Fetched `origin/0.0.2` package metadata reports `@luminarylabs/nexusrealtime-protokits@0.0.2`.
- Fetched `origin/0.0.2` remains latest-ref red because `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js` and the first-wave test import bare package `nexusrealtime` without a resolvable package/workspace/CDN/link model.
- Direct-import aliases remain present in release-ref proof files, but they are not currently executable in a detached release extraction.

## Experiment proof state
- Available Experiments is now latest-ref aligned at `3e047f693f3ed58cab1c362deb09a597398d05e5`, and aggregate `npm run check` passes.
- Experiments aggregate `check` still does not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- Available Experiments targeted DSK proof fails because its sibling ProtoKits checkout is local `main` and lacks the expected `createNCompletionLedgerKit` export.
- Disposable fetched Experiments targeted DSK proof still fails on sibling-relative `NexusRealtime/src/index.js` resolution.
- Public proof route loads HTML but remains human-visible stuck at `Booting...`.
- Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and `Booting...`; console/request output showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.
- Proof route source still uses sibling-relative imports:
  - import map maps `nexusrealtime` to `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  - `src/proof.js` imports `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  - `src/proof.js` imports ProtoKits from `../../../../NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/...`.

## Domain and kit proof coverage
- Core DSK API smoke remains green through `tests/domain-service-kit-smoke.mjs` as part of core `npm test`.
- ProtoKits first-wave service coverage is not proven locally because the available checkout is `main`/`0.0.1` and lacks the first-wave DSK test.
- ProtoKits first-wave service coverage is not proven at fetched `origin/0.0.2` because package `nexusrealtime` is unresolved.
- Experiments first-wave proof is blocked locally by sibling ProtoKits branch/export mismatch and blocked at fetched/public routes by sibling-relative module paths.
- Fetched/available Experiments aggregate proof is green for the current aggregate script, but that script omits the DSK first-wave smoke.
- New neighboring proof inventory includes Telemetry Command Evidence Ownership, Procedural Navigation State Ownership, Scheduler World Mutation Isolation, Query Read Model Isolation, content-boundary/objective proof, runtime identity/lifecycle ownership, composition-proof ownership, proof-signal integrity, AR/spatial read-model, and earlier hardening rows. These are separate from module-source, aggregate-vs-targeted parity, public browser proof, npm availability, and package-version policy.

## Runtime ownership drift
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md`, `docs/how-to-experiment.md`, `docs/protokit-boundaries.md`, and `docs/protokit-experiment-loop.md` still keep the core/ProtoKits/Experiments split explicit.
- New reusable kit implementations should target ProtoKits by default.
- New playable/browser proofs should target Experiments by default.
- Core should stay focused on ECS/runtime/DSK/composer primitives, invariants, exports, and validation.
- Current blockers do not justify moving browser routes, reusable implementation, package-resolution shims, or proof-readiness checklist tooling into core.
- Telemetry/command evidence ownership and procedural/navigation hardening are validation concerns, not reasons to change the public module-source strategy in core.

## Broken/stale proof paths
- Available ProtoKits checkout path is stale for DSK first-wave proof: local `main`/`0.0.1` passes its own aggregate checks but is not the latest release branch and lacks `tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs`.
- Fetched ProtoKits `origin/0.0.2` fails aggregate and targeted DSK checks because package `nexusrealtime` is unresolved.
- Available Experiments targeted DSK proof fails against sibling ProtoKits local `main` due to missing `createNCompletionLedgerKit`.
- Fetched Experiments targeted DSK proof fails on sibling-relative `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
- Broken public proof paths remain:
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`
- Branch/package mismatch remains: core release branch `0.0.2` serves package version `0.1.0`.
- Optional npm metadata remains 404, so npm-backed consumption is not proven.

## Risks
- Available-checkout validation can now mislead: ProtoKits local `main` is green but not release-ref DSK proof.
- Experiments local is latest-ref aligned, but its targeted DSK proof still depends on a sibling ProtoKits checkout that is not release aligned.
- A public route returning HTTP 200 can still fail for users if module paths are not deployed.
- Aggregate validation can stay green while omitting the DSK first-wave proof smoke.
- Disposable validation can fail because package/sibling resolution is not modeled; that must be reported separately from source regression.
- Public consumption language can overclaim if it does not distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch availability from npm registry availability.
- Telemetry/command evidence, procedural/navigation, scheduler/world, query read-model, runtime identity/lifecycle, composition-proof, proof-signal, AR/spatial, and content-boundary/objective hardening rows can improve evidence quality, but fixing them would not prove module-source, npm, package-version, public route, or fetched-ref validation.

## Blockers
- ProtoKits available checkout must be aligned to the preflight-resolved latest release branch before local first-wave DSK proof can be considered.
- ProtoKits fetched `origin/0.0.2` validation needs a package/workspace/CDN/link model that resolves `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments available targeted DSK proof needs sibling ProtoKits release-ref alignment or a module-source model that does not depend on the local sibling branch.
- Experiments fetched `origin/0.0.2` needs targeted DSK validation with a sibling layout or revised module-source strategy.
- Public proof import-map/module source strategy remains unresolved: CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, package/workspace dependency, or build-step import mapping.
- `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` is not wired into Experiments aggregate validation or documented as a required targeted command.
- npm metadata for `nexusrealtime` is unavailable.
- Core branch `0.0.2` still serves package metadata version `0.1.0`; the release/package-version policy remains unclear.
- DSK promotion hardening lacks executable fixture coverage for runtime failure-boundary, procedural/navigation ownership, telemetry/command evidence ownership, scheduler/world mutation isolation, query read-model isolation, runtime identity/lifecycle ownership, composition-proof ownership, proof-signal, AR/spatial, content-boundary/objective, and earlier rows.

## Suggested next review item
- Re-align or explicitly model the ProtoKits release source first, then define one `nexusrealtime` module-source strategy and validate ProtoKits fetched/local DSK proof, Experiments local/fetched targeted DSK smoke, and public browser loading against that same model.
