# Ecosystem State Packet: 2026-06-19T09-12-09-0400

## Scope
- Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem State Packet
- Local timestamp: 2026-06-19T09-12-09-0400
- UTC timestamp: 2026-06-19T13:12:09Z
- Workspace: `/Users/crimsonwheeler/Documents/GitHub/NexusRealtime`
- Repos checked: core NexusRealtime, sibling NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, sibling NexusRealtime-Experiments

## Lane Goal
- Audit NexusRealtime ecosystem state, drift, and proof readiness across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, DSK promotion ledgers, branch targets, public links, and proof paths.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `ecosystem-root-010`.
- Latest ecosystem state packet `2026-06-19T08-13-48-0400` said core and ProtoKits were release-aligned and validation-green, while Experiments was clean but 22 commits behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet `2026-06-19T08-48-39-0400` kept public proof blocked at `Booting...`, targeted DSK proof green, Experiments latest-ref validation open, and aggregate proof categories separate.
- Latest DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T08-23-23-0400` kept bridge phase delivery, step receipts, delegated-action reconciliation, and wrapper state contracts in the DSK promotion gates.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-19T08-56-02-0400` added dataset/reset leaks, economy zero-retention behavior, and pursuit initial-state receipt contradictions.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-19T09-00-53-0400` converted those bugs into source-state integrity proof rows.
- Prior packets and nodes were used for context only. Live checkout state, fetched refs, docs, tests, preflight, public URLs, and Playwright output are authority for this run.

## Agent Workspace State
- Read `.agent/start-here.md`, `.agent/operating-model.md`, `.agent/automation-rules.md`, `.agent/report-format.md`, `.agent/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, `.agent/CHANGE_LOG.md`, and `memory.md`.
- Used `agent-it` mentality without creating missing `.agent` files because this lane is constrained to ecosystem-state packet/node/tracker outputs.
- Repo guidance still requires preflight, latest release branch resolution, live checkout evidence, public-link checks, and lane-local scout outputs.
- Human-view validation question: yes, this route needed launch-state inspection because HTTP 200 does not prove the public proof is usable. Playwright snapshot and screenshot confirmed the public page is visible but stuck at `Booting...`.
- Temporary Playwright scratch files and screenshot artifacts were removed after evidence capture.
- No source, tests, public docs, package metadata, `.agent`, deployment, or canonical repo memory files were edited by this lane.

## Latest Branch Preflight
- Command: `npm run automation:preflight`
- Result: pass
- Preflight timestamp: `2026-06-19T13:08:25.738Z`
- Latest remote release branch: `0.0.2`
- Compare target: `0.0.2`
- Current branch: `0.0.2`
- Branch status: `current-is-latest-release-branch`
- Remote branches observed by core preflight: `0.0.1`, `0.0.2`, `main`
- Core `HEAD`: `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`
- Core `origin/0.0.2`: `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`
- Core ahead/behind against `origin/0.0.2`: `0 0`
- Core package metadata remains `nexusrealtime@0.1.0`.
- Core worktree still contains pre-existing modified/untracked automation and planning docs outside this run. This lane wrote only this packet, one node, and the ecosystem-state tracker update.

## Ecosystem Findings
- Core remains aligned with the latest remote release branch `0.0.2`; `HEAD` equals `origin/0.0.2` at `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`.
- Core validation passed: `npm test` passed all 8 smoke tests.
- Required public core links remain reachable through GitHub, raw GitHub, and jsDelivr.
- Optional npm registry metadata remains unavailable with HTTP 404, so npm-backed public consumption is still not proven.
- ProtoKits remains clean and aligned with fetched `origin/0.0.2`: local and origin both resolve to `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`; ahead/behind `0 0`.
- ProtoKits fetch observed a new non-target remote branch `origin/v2`, but this lane kept comparison tied to the preflight-resolved release branch `0.0.2`.
- ProtoKits validation passed:
  - `npm run check`
  - `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs`
- ProtoKits first-wave ledger still lists seven `promoted-candidate` kits and intentionally defers promotion into core.
- Experiments local checkout remains clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`: local `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f`, origin `6a4982ec59a06b5e0c7c12a56da58eed15866b0f`, ahead/behind `0 22`.
- Experiments targeted available-checkout validation passed: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- Experiments aggregate `npm run check` was not run because it starts with `npm run generate:flat-routes`, and prior state plus current script inspection show that command writes generated route artifacts outside this lane's write scope.
- Local and fetched Experiments `package.json` still omit `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` from aggregate `check`.
- Fetched Experiments `origin/0.0.2` still differs from the local checkout: fetched aggregate check includes `tests/tropical-island-scene-static-smoke.mjs`, while local aggregate check includes `tests/fluid-water-lab-static-smoke.mjs`.
- Public DSK proof route remains HTTP-visible but not browser-ready: Playwright snapshot and screenshot showed the page stuck at `Booting...`; console errors showed 404s for sibling NexusRealtime and ProtoKits module paths.
- Fetched Experiments proof files still import sibling `NexusRealtime` and `NexusRealtime-ProtoKits` relative paths that map to missing GitHub Pages routes.
- Branch/version policy risk remains unchanged: release branch `0.0.2` serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.

## Domain And Kit Expansion Signals
- Current DSK core still exports `defineDomainServiceKit()`, `createDomainServiceToken()`, validation helpers, `createRealtimeGame()`, and runtime-kit primitives from `src/index.js`.
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md` and `docs/how-to-experiment.md` keep ecosystem ownership explicit: core owns runtime/DSK/composer primitives, ProtoKits owns reusable implementation, and Experiments owns playable/browser proof.
- `docs/described_examples.md`, `docs/domain_ideas.md`, and `docs/kits_ideas.md` now include source-state integrity inventory in addition to bridge-state, receipt, spatial/mobility, operations, and distribution proof categories.
- New source-state integrity signals from neighboring lanes:
  - authored dataset clone/freeze isolation for dataset-heavy services.
  - reset-source policy separating authored config, restored state, runtime fields, and reset output.
  - retention-limit semantics for zero, negative, and non-finite ledger/history limits.
  - initial terminal-state receipts for pressure/recovery domains.
- Proof coverage should remain separated by category: local command, latest release-ref command, aggregate command, targeted command, raw-public file, CDN import, npm availability, and browser-complete human proof.

## Evidence
- `npm run automation:preflight` passed and resolved latest branch `0.0.2`.
- Core `git status --short --branch` showed `## 0.0.2...origin/0.0.2` plus pre-existing automation/doc dirt.
- Core `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2` and `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2` showed `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0` with ahead/behind `0 0`.
- Core `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
- ProtoKits `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`, and ahead/behind checks showed clean alignment at `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`.
- ProtoKits `npm run check` passed after checking 294 JavaScript modules, importing 236 ProtoKit indexes, and running the full listed test chain through fluid/water kit composition.
- ProtoKits `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed.
- Experiments `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`, and ahead/behind checks showed clean local checkout behind fetched release ref by 22 commits.
- Experiments `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed.
- Experiments `package.json` and fetched `origin/0.0.2:package.json` show aggregate `check` still omits the targeted DSK first-wave smoke and starts with generated flat-route output.
- Direct curl checks confirmed required proof raw files and ProtoKits ledger are public, while runtime dependency paths used by the public page are 404.
- Playwright opened the public DSK proof route; snapshot showed `Booting...`; console log showed 404s for deployed sibling module paths plus favicon; screenshot visually confirmed the stuck proof page.

## Suggested Canonical Updates
- Validate Experiments at fetched `origin/0.0.2` in a disposable worktree or fast-forwarded clean checkout before claiming latest-ref proof.
- Keep public proof route work focused on module-source resolution: CDN `0.0.2`, deployed same-origin assets, or a build-step import map.
- Wire `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` into an aggregate Experiments validation command or document it as required targeted evidence.
- Update public consumption wording or release policy so docs distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch consumption from unavailable npm registry metadata.
- Decide whether branch `0.0.2` serving package version `0.1.0` is intentional policy or stale release metadata.
- Treat `origin/v2` in ProtoKits as a separate non-release branch until a release-branch resolver says otherwise.
- Keep DSK expansion claims advisory until hardening fixtures include install/namespace, receipt/event identity, bridge phase, wrapper state, source/reset integrity, retention limits, initial terminal receipts, and earlier operations/spatial rows.
- Keep Experiments aggregate validation in a disposable worktree or make flat-route generation idempotent/cleanup-safe before scout lanes run it.

## Knowledge Nodes
- Wrote `state/automation/ecosystem_state_scout/knowledge_nodes/2026-06-19T09-12-09-0400-ecosystem-state-node.md`.
- New root lesson: core and ProtoKits remain release-aligned and validation-green, but Experiments latest release-ref validation, browser-complete public proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy, and DSK hardening/source-state gates remain open.

## Master Tracker Updates
- Added `ecosystem-root-011`.
- Marked `ecosystem-root-010` as superseded by `ecosystem-root-011`.
- Added child branches for aligned core/ProtoKits proof, Experiments latest-ref drift, public proof import shape, aggregate DSK proof validation, source-state hardening, generated route validation boundary, public npm gap, package-version policy, and DSK hardening proof gates.
