# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem_state_scout 2026-06-19T16-09-07-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-root-018
- statement: Core remains current and validation-green, but ecosystem proof readiness is unchanged: module-source strategy still blocks ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof, and public browser proof; newer lifecycle parity rows are real hardening inventory but separate from distribution proof.
- why it matters: Promotion review still needs one explicit module-source model before fetched-ref and public proof can converge, and it must not confuse that distribution gate with runtime failure-boundary, experience-edge, or lifecycle parity hardening.

## Child Nodes
- id: core-still-current-2026-06-19-1609
  parent: ecosystem-root-018
  lesson: Core still matches the preflight-resolved latest release branch and passes its smoke suite.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ahead/behind was `0 0`; `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
  look further: Keep resolving latest release refs each run because sibling refs continue to drift.
- id: protokits-package-resolution-2026-06-19-1609
  parent: ecosystem-root-018
  lesson: ProtoKits local available-checkout proof is green, but fetched latest-ref proof still fails without a resolvable `nexusrealtime` package.
  evidence: Local ProtoKits `npm run check` and `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed at `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`; disposable extracted `origin/0.0.2` at `06f5f3bd35e3b4c2c24d49d4affbe026b0d92c8f` failed `smoke:imports` with 110 import failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`; targeted DSK smoke failed for the same package.
  look further: Validate fetched ProtoKits with a declared package, workspace, CDN, or link model for NexusRealtime.
- id: experiments-targeted-fetched-ref-resolution-2026-06-19-1609
  parent: ecosystem-root-018
  lesson: Experiments fetched-ref aggregate proof can pass while fetched-ref targeted DSK proof fails on sibling-relative imports.
  evidence: Disposable extracted Experiments `origin/0.0.2` at `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb` passed `npm run check`; targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed because `src/proof.js` resolved `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js` to missing `/private/tmp/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  look further: Run targeted DSK proof with the same module-source strategy intended for public proof.
- id: public-proof-import-shape-2026-06-19-1609
  parent: ecosystem-root-018
  lesson: The public DSK proof route remains HTTP-visible but browser-stuck at `Booting...`.
  evidence: Curl returned 200 for the proof route; Playwright snapshot showed heading text plus `Booting...`; console/request output showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or a build-step import map for the public proof route.
- id: module-source-strategy-2026-06-19-1609
  parent: ecosystem-root-018
  lesson: ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof, and public browser proof remain one module-source problem.
  evidence: ProtoKits failed on package-name `nexusrealtime`; Experiments targeted proof failed on missing sibling `NexusRealtime`; public route failed on deployed sibling module 404s.
  look further: Define one resolution model and use it in local, disposable, and public proof paths.
- id: aggregate-dsk-proof-validation-2026-06-19-1609
  parent: ecosystem-root-018
  lesson: Experiments aggregate validation still omits the DSK first-wave smoke.
  evidence: Local and fetched Experiments `package.json` `check` scripts do not list `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`; disposable fetched aggregate check passed separately from the targeted DSK smoke failure.
  look further: Add the DSK smoke to an aggregate check, or document it as required targeted release evidence.
- id: generated-route-validation-boundary-2026-06-19-1609
  parent: ecosystem-root-018
  lesson: Experiments aggregate validation remains write-producing and should stay disposable for scout lanes.
  evidence: Disposable fetched Experiments `npm run check` generated 100 flat route wrappers; this lane did not run aggregate generation in the main Experiments checkout.
  look further: Make route generation idempotent, add cleanup policy, or standardize disposable validation worktrees.
- id: lifecycle-parity-hardening-2026-06-19-1609
  parent: ecosystem-root-018
  lesson: Lifecycle parity rows now join hardening inventory separately from distribution proof.
  evidence: Deep bug node `2026-06-19T15-53-59-0400` and domain idea node `2026-06-19T16-01-29-0400` add movement receipt transitions, terrain query/chunk parity, partial-start cleanup, and AR session stop-state semantics.
  look further: Decide which lifecycle rows belong in core tests, ProtoKits policy tests, or Experiments harnesses after the module-source and base runtime-hardening categories remain explicit.
- id: public-consumption-npm-gap-2026-06-19-1609
  parent: ecosystem-root-018
  lesson: GitHub/raw/jsDelivr consumption remains reachable while npm package metadata still returns 404.
  evidence: `npm run automation:preflight` returned 200 for required GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links and 404 for `https://registry.npmjs.org/nexusrealtime`.
  look further: `README.md`, `package.json`, npm publication policy, and public consumption wording.
- id: package-version-policy-2026-06-19-1609
  parent: ecosystem-root-018
  lesson: Release branch `0.0.2` still serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.
  evidence: Local package metadata and raw public branch metadata report `nexusrealtime@0.1.0`; preflight confirmed raw public `0.0.2/package.json` is reachable.
  look further: Branch naming policy, package version policy, and README release wording.
