# DSK Architecture State Packet

## Timestamp
- 2026-06-19T13-24-43-0400

## Lane Goal
- Audit DSK architecture, contracts, invariants, scaling, and promotion risk for long-term NexusRealtime production viability.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `dsk-lifecycle-config-fixture-root-2026-06-19-1223`.
- Latest DSK packet `2026-06-19T12-23-47-0400` kept core release-aligned and test-green, but said the executable hardening handoff must include lifecycle/config rows alongside namespace, install, dependency, source-state, state-signal, receipt, bridge, operations, and spatial gates.
- Latest ecosystem state node `2026-06-19T13-09-40-0400` says core remains latest-ref aligned and validation-green, while sibling proof blockers have sharpened into module-resolution gates for ProtoKits, Experiments targeted proof, and public browser proof.
- Latest ecosystem proof node `2026-06-19T12-39-48-0400` keeps local checkout proof separate from fetched-ref proof, standalone package resolution, aggregate checks, targeted DSK checks, and browser-complete public proof.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-19T12-54-22-0400` adds traversal/procedural/physics rows: negative path costs, duplicate navmesh identity, procedural signature drift, and duplicate/stale recovery receipts/state.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-19T13-01-05-0400` maps those bug rows into traversal proof integrity planning inventory.
- State packets were context only. Live source, docs, tests, preflight, git refs, and focused probes were authority for this run.

  - Result: both refs resolve to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ahead/behind `0 0`.
- `git status --short --branch`
  - Result: `## 0.0.2...origin/0.0.2` plus pre-existing modified/untracked automation and planning docs.
- `git diff --stat origin/0.0.2 -- src/domain-service-kit.js src/runtime-kit.js src/game-kit-composer.js src/index.js tests/domain-service-kit-smoke.mjs tests/public-api-freeze.mjs tests/run-all.mjs README.md memory.md docs/described_examples.md docs/domain_ideas.md docs/kits_ideas.md docs/how-to-protokit.md state/automation/dsk_architecture_scout`
  - Result before this packet: no source/test/runtime diff; pre-existing tracked diffs in expansion docs and this lane tracker.
- `npm test`
  - Result: pass, 8 smoke tests.
- First focused `node --input-type=module` probe attempt
  - Result: discarded; used nonexistent `world.subscribe` API.
- Corrected focused `node --input-type=module` DSK/traversal probe
  - Result: reconfirmed reserved `apiName:"__proto__"` is not an own namespace key, failed API collision leaves partial DSK state, direct install allows missing `runtime:needed`, negative path costs resolve as valid, duplicate walkability keys emit duplicate navmesh/waypoint ids, procedural signatures ignore algorithm descriptor changes, and WorldPhysics fall recovery emits duplicate receipts with mismatched final state.

## DSK contract state
- `defineRuntimeKit()` remains the low-level installable primitive for components, resources, events, systems, bindings, registries, sequences, sequence nodes, metadata, and install hooks.
- `defineDomainServiceKit()` still wraps runtime kits with required domain/stability/version metadata, default `n-<domain>-kit` ids, `n:` capability tokens, optional service tokens, and `engine.n.<apiName>` installation (`src/domain-service-kit.js:165-195`).
- DSK metadata still declares linear execution with async-ready, serializable-state, reset, and snapshot expectations (`src/domain-service-kit.js:131-139`), but those are metadata, not enforced runtime boundaries.
- `engine.n` is still created as a plain object and late API assignment happens inside the install hook (`src/domain-service-kit.js:143-161`).
- `installRuntimeKit()` still records DSK metadata and pushes kits before late install hooks complete (`src/runtime-kit.js:135-157`, `src/runtime-kit.js:214-216`).
- Direct DSK install still enforces only missing `n:` requirements (`src/runtime-kit.js:142-145`), while `createGameKitComposer()` checks all `requires` tokens during composition (`src/game-kit-composer.js:49-76`).
- Public exports and DSK smoke coverage remain present (`src/index.js:28-41`, `tests/domain-service-kit-smoke.mjs:64-134`, `tests/public-api-freeze.mjs:19-24`).

## Invariant coverage
- Covered today: DSK export presence, basic creation/validation, metadata shape, token generation, DSK extension duplicate checks, direct missing `n:` requirement failure, basic API install, serializable snapshot happy path, idempotent same-object reinstall, same-id duplicate rejection, and normal API collision throw.
- Still not covered: reserved API names, own-property namespace guarantees, failed-install rollback, direct non-`n:` dependency policy, duplicate provider-token diagnostics, reset/snapshot absence/failure/non-serializable behavior, async metadata boundaries, source-state isolation, receipt identity, event idempotency, bridge phase, wrapper state, operations finite data, spatial/mobility bounds, state-signal contracts, command lifecycle, elapsed-rate policy, descriptor normalization/source isolation, finite generated geometry, traversal cost policy, navmesh identity, procedural signature taxonomy, and recovery receipt/state consistency.
- Focused probe evidence:
  - DSK base: reserved API probe returned `own:false` and `marker:"__proto__-api"`; failed collision retained `n-late-collision-kit` in both `engine.kits` and `engine.domainServiceKits`; missing `runtime:needed` installed.
  - Traversal: pathfinding resolved a route through a `cost:-5` cell with total `cost:-4`; duplicate walkability keys emitted `["cell-shared","cell-shared"]` and `["wp-cell-shared","wp-cell-shared"]`; two procedural snapshots with different algorithm descriptors shared signature `5b741c67`; WorldPhysics emitted two `fall` soft-respawn receipts and left `PhysicsState.playerPosition.y` at `1` while player position was `1.25`.

## Domain and kit expansion architecture notes
- Repo memory and docs keep the ownership split stable: core owns ECS/runtime/DSK/composer primitives and validation invariants; ProtoKits owns new reusable implementations; Experiments owns browser/playable proof.
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md` says new reusable kits belong in NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, while core receives DSK contract, validation, scheduler, ECS, or runtime primitive changes.
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`, `docs/kits_ideas.md`, and `docs/described_examples.md` now include traversal proof integrity inventory, but those rows are planning inventory, not release claims.
- The DSK architecture implication is now narrower: the non-scout fixture handoff should add traversal proof integrity rows, not expand core kit promotion.
- Neighboring ecosystem/proof context still matters: module-source/public proof blockers are separate from runtime hardening, so promotion evidence must stay separated by category.

## Scaling risks
- Broad DSK promotion increases `engine.n` collision, inherited-key, reserved-key, and ownership risks while `engine.n` remains a normal object.
- Partial installs can leave metadata, kit lists, bindings, world state, scheduler state, sequence runtimes, or namespace APIs inconsistent after a late throw.
- Direct-install and composer dependency behavior can diverge for the same kit graph.
- Metadata-only reset/snapshot/async expectations are too weak for replay, restore, worker, network, or long-lived engine claims.
- Traversal proof can look green while A* receives invalid costs, graph ids collide, generation signatures omit proof-relevant config, or recovery events double-count one fall.
- Module-source proof can drift independently from runtime hardening: fetched-ref ProtoKits package resolution, fetched-ref Experiments targeted proof, public browser proof, aggregate proof, npm availability, and package-version policy are separate gates.

## Bug candidates
- Confirmed: reserved namespace API key. `apiName:"__proto__"` installs through prototype behavior without an own `engine.n` slot.
- Confirmed: failed API collision install is non-atomic. A late collision throws but leaves failed DSK metadata and kit identity installed.
- Confirmed/design gap: direct DSK install allows missing non-`n:` requirements while composer rejects unresolved `requires`.
- Confirmed: Pathfinding accepts negative traversal costs and can return a negative total path cost.
- Confirmed: NavMesh generation allows duplicate walkability keys to emit duplicate cell and waypoint ids.
- Confirmed: Procedural snapshot signatures ignore changed algorithm descriptors.
- Confirmed: WorldPhysics fall recovery emits duplicate `SoftRespawn` receipts and returns before final `PhysicsState.playerPosition` matches the respawned player.
- Candidate: the non-scout DSK fixture handoff should now include traversal proof integrity rows with prior namespace, install, dependency, source-state, state-signal, receipt, bridge, operations, spatial, and lifecycle/config rows.

## Missing tests
- Reserved `apiName` handling for `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`.
- Own-property assertions for every installed `engine.n` API.
- Failed install rollback after API collision, `initWorld` throw, registry throw, scheduler add throw, sequence runtime throw, sequence node runtime throw, and install hook throw.
- Direct install parity or documented divergence for non-`n:` `requires` tokens.
- Duplicate provider-token diagnostics across different DSK ids.
- End-to-end `extendDomainServiceKit()` install behavior.
- Reset/snapshot absence, failure, non-serializable state, restore, and reset policy coverage.
- Async metadata tests that explicitly prove async is metadata-only today.
- Traversal proof fixtures for negative/zero/non-finite route costs, duplicate walkability/navmesh/waypoint identity, procedural algorithm/config signature completeness, and one-shot recovery receipts with final-state consistency.
- Aggregate proof wiring that keeps runtime hardening, targeted proof, public browser proof, latest-ref sibling proof, npm availability, and package-version policy separate.

## Promotion risks
- Do not promote broad ProtoKit or domain idea graphs into core until namespace safety, install atomicity, dependency policy, state contract enforcement, service-call policy, receipt integrity, bridge phase, wrapper-state contracts, source-state integrity, state-signal contracts, lifecycle/config policy, and traversal proof integrity are designed and tested.
- Do not claim async DSK execution, worker readiness, network partitioning, replay/restore support, or production DSK safety from metadata and smoke tests alone.
- Do not treat public route HTTP 200, GitHub/raw/jsDelivr availability, local targeted proof, or fetched aggregate proof as runtime hardening proof.
- Do not claim npm package availability; optional npm metadata remains 404.
- Do not claim sibling fetched-ref proof is fully green; neighboring state/proof packets report module-resolution blockers.
- Do not treat idea docs as canonical public architecture or promotion approval.

## Suggested next review item
- Use a non-scout lane to write the smallest executable DSK promotion hardening fixture set:
  - `engine.n` namespace policy
  - install preflight/rollback transaction boundaries
  - direct-install dependency parity versus composer-only policy
  - reset/snapshot/serialization enforcement or explicit metadata-only policy
  - authored-source/reset-source/retention/initial-terminal rows
  - descriptor invalidation/action repeat/transition/coordinate/derived-state rows
  - command lifecycle/elapsed-rate/descriptor normalization/generated-geometry rows
  - traversal cost/navmesh identity/procedural signature/recovery receipt-state rows
  - receipt/bridge/wrapper/operations/spatial rows carried from earlier packets

## Not claimed
- No bugs were fixed.
- No source, tests, docs, examples, package metadata, repo memory, public claims, `.agent` files, ProtoKits, Experiments, or deployments were edited.
- Passing `npm test` does not prove production DSK readiness.
- This packet does not prove browser UX, public proof completion, npm publication, sibling latest-ref validation, async execution, worker/network readiness, replay/restore support, or broad domain graph promotion.
