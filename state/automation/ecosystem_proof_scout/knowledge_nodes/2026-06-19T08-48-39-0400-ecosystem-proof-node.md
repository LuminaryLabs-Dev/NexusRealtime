# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem proof scout 2026-06-19T08-48-39-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-proof-010
- statement: Ecosystem proof regressed from all-sibling latest-ref green: core and ProtoKits still align with `origin/0.0.2`, but Experiments is 22 commits behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`, public browser proof still fails at module loading, aggregate DSK proof remains separate, and aggregate ProtoKits validation was incomplete in this run.
- why it matters: Promotion review must distinguish targeted local DSK proof from aggregate validation, latest-ref validation, public browser proof, and runtime hardening proof.

## Child Nodes
- id: ecosystem-proof-010-a
  parent: ecosystem-proof-010
  lesson: Core and ProtoKits match the latest release branch while Experiments does not.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ProtoKits both resolved to `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`; Experiments local `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f` and origin `6a4982ec59a06b5e0c7c12a56da58eed15866b0f` showed ahead/behind `0 22`.
  look further: Fast-forward or separately validate Experiments at fetched `origin/0.0.2`.
- id: ecosystem-proof-010-b
  parent: ecosystem-proof-010
  lesson: Targeted first-wave DSK proof passes locally, but aggregate proof is not fully established this run.
  evidence: Core `npm test`, ProtoKits `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs`, and Experiments `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed; ProtoKits `npm run check` was interrupted after no progress output during `check:syntax`; Experiments aggregate `npm run check` was skipped because it starts with route generation.
  look further: Use bounded validation splits or disposable worktrees for aggregate checks that are long-running or write generated artifacts.
- id: ecosystem-proof-010-c
  parent: ecosystem-proof-010
  lesson: Public DSK proof remains HTTP-visible but browser-stuck at `Booting...`.
  evidence: Playwright opened `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/`; snapshot showed `Booting...`; console and curl evidence showed 404s for sibling NexusRealtime and ProtoKits module paths.
  look further: Do not treat HTTP 200 on the route as browser-complete proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-010-d
  parent: ecosystem-proof-010
  lesson: The public proof import shape still targets sibling GitHub Pages paths that are not deployed.
  evidence: Fetched `origin/0.0.2` proof HTML maps `nexusrealtime` to `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`; `src/proof.js` imports sibling `NexusRealtime` and `NexusRealtime-ProtoKits` relative paths; direct curls returned 404 for those deployed URLs.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or a build-step import map.
- id: ecosystem-proof-010-e
  parent: ecosystem-proof-010
  lesson: Fetched Experiments aggregate validation still omits the DSK first-wave smoke.
  evidence: `origin/0.0.2:package.json` `check` script does not list `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`; it lists `tests/tropical-island-scene-static-smoke.mjs`; targeted DSK smoke passed only on the local available checkout.
  look further: Add the DSK smoke to an aggregate check or document it as required targeted release evidence.
- id: ecosystem-proof-010-f
  parent: ecosystem-proof-010
  lesson: Available Experiments proof surface differs from fetched release-ref surface.
  evidence: Local `package.json` lists `tests/fluid-water-lab-static-smoke.mjs`; fetched `origin/0.0.2:package.json` lists `tests/tropical-island-scene-static-smoke.mjs`; local checkout is behind by 22 commits.
  look further: Separate local available-checkout proof from latest-ref proof in every public-promotion review.
- id: ecosystem-proof-010-g
  parent: ecosystem-proof-010
  lesson: Bridge-state hardening now constrains DSK proof claims beyond first-wave install success.
  evidence: DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T08-23-23-0400` adds bridge phase delivery, step-transition receipts, delegated-action reconciliation, and wrapper state contracts; deep bug node `2026-06-19T07-53-41-0400` supplies source-level examples.
  look further: Keep runtime hardening fixtures separate from distribution/public-browser proof.
