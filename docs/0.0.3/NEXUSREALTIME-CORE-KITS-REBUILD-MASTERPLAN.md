# NexusRealtime Core Kits Rebuild Masterplan

This is the execution plan for rebuilding `LuminaryLabs-Dev/NexusRealtime` around broad, configurable **core capability domains**.

It reviews the documentation stack part by part, explains each document in simple terms, and turns each document into implementation work.

This plan is intentionally scoped to the main NexusRealtime repository only.

```txt
Repository: LuminaryLabs-Dev/NexusRealtime
Branch: main
Plan type: breaking rebuild plan
Compatibility goal: document migration, not preserve old imports forever
Satellite repos: do not change yet
```

Do not change these repos in this rebuild pass:

```txt
LuminaryLabs-Agents/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits
LuminaryLabs-Agents/NexusRealtime-Experiments
LuminaryLabs-Agents/NexusRealtime-Sandbox
LuminaryLabs-Agents/NexusRealtime-KitBuilder01
LuminaryLabs-Agents/NexusRealtime-KitBuilder02
LuminaryLabs-Agents/NexusRealtime-KitBuilder03
```

---

## Simple summary

```txt
We are rebuilding NexusRealtime so the main package becomes:

kernel
  + contracts
  + foundation primitives
  + core capability domains
  + adapters
  + diagnostics
  + migration docs
```

Core capability domains are the stable bubbles.

ProtoKits will later compose bigger bubbles from them.

Experiments will later prove the bigger bubbles.

This plan does not patch those repos yet.

---

## Source documents reviewed

### 1. `src/core-kits/core-domain.md`

Simple meaning:

```txt
This file defines what a core capability domain is.
```

Important rule from it:

```txt
A core capability domain is not a tiny helper.
A core capability domain is not a locked monolith.
It is a stable, configurable, data-driven, event-driven domain bubble.
```

What we need to do from it:

```txt
[ ] Keep every core kit data-driven.
[ ] Keep every core kit event-driven.
[ ] Give every core kit override points.
[ ] Give every core kit adapter boundaries when needed.
[ ] Give every core kit snapshot/reset expectations.
[ ] Make every core kit useful out of the gate.
[ ] Keep niche, genre, platform, and composite kits outside this repo for now.
```

### 2. `docs/0.0.3/CORE-KITS-MASSIVE-DOCS-PLAN.md`

Simple meaning:

```txt
This file lists the whole documentation and implementation spine.
```

Important rule from it:

```txt
No boundary doc, no core.
No how-to-use doc, no core.
No snapshot/reset, no core.
No deterministic headless proof, no core.
No migration note for breaking imports, no main-branch break.
```

What we need to do from it:

```txt
[ ] Create every architecture doc.
[ ] Create every per-kit doc.
[ ] Create every how-to-use doc.
[ ] Create every source-domain doc.
[ ] Create examples.
[ ] Create breaking change docs.
[ ] Create app migration docs.
[ ] Then rebuild source folders and factories.
```

[ ] src/contracts/
[ ] src/foundation/
[ ] src/core-kits/<22 domains>/
[ ] src/adapters/
[ ] src/legacy-kits/
```

## Step 2: Add barrel exports before moving code

Simple meaning:

```txt
Make the new paths exist before deleting old paths.
```

First barrels:

```txt
src/core-kits/core-input-kit/index.js
src/core-kits/core-graphics-kit/index.js
src/core-kits/core-interaction-kit/index.js
src/core-kits/core-simulation-kit/index.js
src/core-kits/core-diagnostics-kit/index.js
```

Seed with existing flat files:

```txt
core-input-kit         -> ../../input-intent-kit.js
core-graphics-kit      -> ../../render-descriptor-kit.js
core-interaction-kit   -> ../../interaction-target-kit.js
core-simulation-kit    -> ../../timing-window-kit.js
                       -> ../../resource-pressure-kit.js
                       -> ../../objective-flow-kit.js
core-diagnostics-kit   -> ../../telemetry-kit.js
```

## Step 3: Create foundation primitives

```txt
[ ] src/foundation/seeded-random.js
[ ] src/foundation/snapshot.js
[ ] src/foundation/serializable-state.js
[ ] src/foundation/completion-ledger.js
[ ] src/foundation/idempotency-ledger.js
[ ] src/foundation/progress-timer.js
[ ] src/foundation/deterministic-replay.js
[ ] src/foundation/promotion-guard.js
```

## Step 4: Create umbrella factories

```txt
[ ] createCoreDataKit()
[ ] createCorePersistenceKit()
[ ] createCoreAssetsKit()
[ ] createCorePlatformKit()
[ ] createCoreInputKit()
[ ] createCoreSpatialKit()
[ ] createCoreSceneKit()
[ ] createCorePhysicsKit()
[ ] createCoreMotionKit()
[ ] createCoreSimulationKit()
[ ] createCoreInteractionKit()
[ ] createCoreGraphicsKit()
[ ] createCoreCameraKit()
[ ] createCoreAnimationKit()
[ ] createCoreAudioKit()
[ ] createCoreUIKit()
[ ] createCoreNetworkKit()
[ ] createCoreDiagnosticsKit()
[ ] createCorePolicyKit()
[ ] createCoreCompositionKit()
[ ] createCoreMLNNKit()
[ ] createCoreAgentKit()
```

## Step 5: Add mock-first AI

```txt
core-mlnn-kit
  [ ] deterministic mock model adapter
  [ ] inference request descriptor
  [ ] inference result descriptor
  [ ] model registry

core-agent-kit
  [ ] rule-based agent adapter
  [ ] observation descriptor
  [ ] action proposal descriptor
  [ ] execution ledger

core-policy-kit
  [ ] action allow/block validation

core-diagnostics-kit
  [ ] capture agent decision evidence
```

## Step 6: Add tests

Test folders:

```txt
tests/foundation/
tests/core-kits/
tests/promotion/
```

Required test types:

```txt
[ ] barrel export smoke
[ ] default config smoke
[ ] custom config smoke
[ ] policy override smoke
[ ] adapter override smoke
[ ] snapshot/reset smoke
[ ] deterministic event smoke
[ ] serializable state smoke
[ ] no browser dependency smoke
[ ] composition smoke
[ ] import migration smoke
```

## Step 7: Update package exports

Simple meaning:

```txt
The public package should expose the new core domain factories.
```

Tasks:

```txt
[ ] Export every createCore<Name>Kit from src/index.js.
[ ] Add package export paths if package.json needs subpath exports.
[ ] Document every changed export in IMPORT-MIGRATION-MAP.md.
[ ] Remove old flat compatibility only in the final breaking commit.
```

## Step 8: Move or remove old flat files

Simple meaning:

```txt
After docs, tests, and migration guides exist, old flat files can be moved or replaced.
```

Tasks:

```txt
[ ] Move seed files into correct core domain folders or replace them with domain modules.
[ ] Update internal imports.
[ ] Update src/index.js.
[ ] Run tests.
[ ] Update BREAKING-CHANGES.md.
[ ] Update IMPORT-MIGRATION-MAP.md.
```

# Final target public API

```js
import {
  createRealtimeGame,
  createCoreDataKit,
  createCorePersistenceKit,
  createCoreAssetsKit,
  createCorePlatformKit,
  createCoreInputKit,
  createCoreSpatialKit,
  createCoreSceneKit,
  createCorePhysicsKit,
  createCoreMotionKit,
  createCoreSimulationKit,
  createCoreInteractionKit,
  createCoreGraphicsKit,
  createCoreCameraKit,
  createCoreAnimationKit,
  createCoreAudioKit,
  createCoreUIKit,
  createCoreNetworkKit,
  createCoreDiagnosticsKit,
  createCorePolicyKit,
  createCoreCompositionKit,
  createCoreMLNNKit,
  createCoreAgentKit
} from "nexusrealtime";
```

Example stack:

```js
const engine = createRealtimeGame({
  kits: [
    createCoreDataKit(),
    createCorePlatformKit(),
    createCoreInputKit(),
    createCoreSceneKit(),
    createCoreSpatialKit(),
    createCoreSimulationKit(),
    createCoreInteractionKit(),
    createCoreGraphicsKit(),
    createCoreAudioKit(),
    createCoreDiagnosticsKit(),
    createCorePolicyKit(),
    createCoreMLNNKit({ adapters: { mock: true } }),
    createCoreAgentKit({ agents: [{ id: "builder-agent" }] })
  ]
});
```

# Final warning

This is a breaking rebuild plan.

Backward compatibility is not the goal.

Documented migration is the goal.

```txt
Do not silently break apps.
Do not touch ProtoKits yet.
Do not touch Experiments yet.
Do not touch Sandbox yet.
Do not touch KitBuilder repos yet.
Do rebuild NexusRealtime main with clear docs, tests, and migration packets.
```
