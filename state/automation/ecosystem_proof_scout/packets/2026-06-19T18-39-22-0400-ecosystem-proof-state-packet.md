# Ecosystem Proof State Packet

Timestamp: 2026-06-19T18:39:22-0400
Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem Proof State Packet
Scope: NexusRealtime core, NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, NexusRealtime-Experiments
Result: partial; core and local available-checkout proof are green, but fetched-ref and browser proof remain blocked by module-source resolution.

## Lane Goal
- Audit proof coverage across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, public routes, and DSK expansion ideas.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `ecosystem-proof-019`.
- Latest proof packet/node `2026-06-19T17-39-50-0400` kept the active blocker on module-source strategy: ProtoKits fetched-ref cannot resolve package `nexusrealtime`, Experiments fetched-ref targeted DSK proof cannot resolve sibling `NexusRealtime`, and the public route remains stuck at `Booting...`.
- Latest ecosystem state packet/node `2026-06-19T18-09-41-0400` confirmed the same module-source blocker and added proof-readiness queueing as planning inventory, not proof.
- Latest DSK architecture packet/node `2026-06-19T18-24-11-0400` kept runtime failure-boundary as tranche 1, lifecycle parity as tranche 2, query/command semantics as tranche 3, experience-edge as tranche 4, and proof-readiness queueing as a separate claim-management layer.
- Latest deep bug packet/node `2026-06-19T16-54-05-0400` remains the current query/command semantics source evidence: terminal guidance receipts, repeated proximity query receipts, rejected-command state corruption, and live route query mutation.
- Latest domain idea packet/node `2026-06-19T18-01-47-0400` converted repeated proof-boundary evidence into proof-readiness queueing: hardening fixture order, proof claim taxonomy, module-source gate, aggregate/targeted proof parity, and release evidence rows.
- State packets were context only. Live source, fetched refs, commands, public URLs, and Playwright launch-state output are authority for this run.

## Commands run
- NexusRealtime: `npm run automation:preflight` -> passed; latest branch `0.0.2`; required GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links OK; optional npm metadata 404.
- NexusRealtime/ProtoKits/Experiments: `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`, `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2`.
- NexusRealtime: `npm test` -> passed 8 smoke tests.
- ProtoKits local available checkout: `npm run check` -> passed; checked 294 JavaScript modules, imported 236 ProtoKit indexes, skipped 2 remote URL forwarders, and ran the local smoke chain through fluid/water kit composition.
- ProtoKits local available checkout: `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` -> passed.
- Experiments local available checkout: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` -> passed.
- ProtoKits disposable fetched-ref extraction at `origin/0.0.2`: `npm run check` -> failed after checking 296 JavaScript modules because `smoke:imports` had 110 import failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
- ProtoKits disposable fetched-ref targeted DSK smoke: `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` -> failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref extraction at `origin/0.0.2`: `npm run check` -> passed after generating 100 flat route wrappers in the disposable directory.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref targeted DSK smoke: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` -> failed because `experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/src/proof.js` imports `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, resolving to missing `/private/tmp/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
- Public URL checks used direct `curl -L -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"`. The first loop used zsh reserved variable `status` and failed; the rerun with `http_code` succeeded and is the evidence recorded below.
- Human-view validation question: Have I checked what the human would actually see, and do I need screenshots, visual inspection, launch-state inspection, or before/after comparison to validate this properly? Answer: yes; launch-state inspection is required because the public proof route is user-visible and prior state reported stuck boot.
- Human-view validation used Playwright CLI. Snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and `Booting...`; console output showed 404s for sibling NexusRealtime and ProtoKits module paths. Playwright scratch artifacts were removed.
- Targeted `rg`/file inspections checked DSK aliases, `engine.n.*`, compatibility shims, public import maps, stale pins, aggregate scripts, proof coverage, and ownership docs.

## ProtoKits migration state
- First-wave DSK ledger remains public on raw `0.0.2` and lists promoted-candidate kits: token-registry, completion-ledger, scan-survey, route-checkpoint, resource-pressure, zone-field, and hazard-director.
- Ledger still says all first-wave kits install through `nexus-dsk-adapter`, return `defineDomainServiceKit()` objects with the real NexusRealtime runtime, keep old injected-runtime calls as migration shims, and defer promotion into core.
- Direct-import aliases remain present locally: `createNZoneFieldKit`, `createNScanSurveyKit`, `createNRouteCheckpointKit`, `createNResourcePressureKit`, `createNHazardDirectorKit`, `createNTokenRegistryKit`, and `createNCompletionLedgerKit`.
- Local available-checkout first-wave migration test passed and still proves direct `createN...Kit()` usage, `engine.n.*` APIs, compatibility `engine.*` APIs, serializable snapshots, and missing-token failure.
- Fetched ProtoKits `origin/0.0.2` is 5 commits ahead and includes `node tests/universal-game-domain-kits.test.mjs` in aggregate validation, but disposable latest-ref aggregate and targeted DSK validation fail before source behavior can be assessed because `nexusrealtime` is not resolvable as a package.
- Compatibility shim risk remains: old injected-runtime and legacy `engine.*` APIs are intentional migration support, but no removal condition was found in this scout pass.

## Experiment proof state
- Local targeted DSK proof passes on the available Experiments checkout: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- The available Experiments checkout is clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2` by 24 commits, so local targeted proof is not latest-ref proof.
- Fetched Experiments aggregate `npm run check` passed in a disposable extraction, including `tests/tropical-island-scene-static-smoke.mjs`, but still does not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- Fetched Experiments targeted DSK proof failed in a disposable extraction for the same sibling relative-path assumption used by the public browser route.
- Local aggregate `check` includes `tests/fluid-water-lab-static-smoke.mjs`; fetched aggregate `check` includes `tests/tropical-island-scene-static-smoke.mjs`.
- Public proof route loads HTML but remains human-visible stuck at `Booting...`.
- Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and `Booting...`; console output showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.
- Local proof files still import from sibling relative paths:
  - import map maps `nexusrealtime` to `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  - `src/proof.js` imports `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  - `src/proof.js` imports ProtoKits from `../../../../NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/...`.

## Domain and kit proof coverage
- Core DSK API smoke remains green through `tests/domain-service-kit-smoke.mjs` as part of core `npm test`.
- ProtoKits first-wave service coverage is green on the local available checkout only; fetched latest-ref aggregate and targeted proof are blocked by standalone package resolution.
- Experiments first-wave proof is green only as a targeted local available-checkout smoke; it is not aggregate proof, latest-ref targeted proof, or browser-complete public proof.
- Fetched Experiments aggregate proof is green for the current aggregate script, but that script omits the DSK first-wave smoke.
- Expanded proof inventory now includes proof-readiness queueing alongside query/command semantics rows, lifecycle parity rows, experience-edge rows, runtime failure-boundary, traversal proof integrity, lifecycle/config, source-state integrity, state-signal contracts, bridge-state ownership, receipt integrity, spatial/mobility, operations data, and public distribution categories.
- Coverage categories remain separate: local command proof, latest release-ref command proof, aggregate command proof, targeted DSK command proof, raw-public file proof, CDN import proof, npm availability, browser-complete human proof, runtime hardening fixture proof, lifecycle parity proof, query/command semantics proof, experience-edge proof, module-source gate, aggregate/targeted proof parity, proof claim taxonomy, and release evidence checklist.

## Runtime ownership drift
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md`, `docs/how-to-experiment.md`, `docs/protokit-boundaries.md`, and `docs/protokit-experiment-loop.md` still keep the core/ProtoKits/Experiments split explicit.
- New reusable kit implementations should target ProtoKits by default.
- New playable/browser proofs should target Experiments by default.
- Core should stay focused on ECS/runtime/DSK/composer primitives, invariants, exports, and validation.
- Current public proof blockers do not justify moving product routes, browser proof wiring, reusable implementation, or proof-readiness checklist tooling into core.
- Runtime failure-boundary, lifecycle parity, query/command semantics, experience-edge, and proof-readiness queueing rows are validation or claim-management concerns, but they are separate from the public route import strategy.

## Broken/stale proof paths
- Broken public proof paths remain:
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`
- Disposable latest-ref targeted proof failed on analogous sibling/package resolution paths.
- Stale public pins remain visible in Experiments and ProtoKits scans, including `main`, `0.0.1`, and legacy route/config CDN references.
- Branch/package mismatch remains: release branch `0.0.2` serves core package version `0.1.0`.
- Optional npm metadata remains 404, so npm-backed consumption is not proven.

## Risks
- A public route returning HTTP 200 can still fail for users if module paths are not deployed.
- Aggregate validation can stay green while omitting the DSK first-wave proof smoke.
- Available-checkout targeted proof can be mistaken for latest-ref proof when sibling repos are behind fetched release refs.
- Disposable validation can fail because package/sibling resolution is not modeled; that must be reported separately from source regression.
- Validation commands that generate flat routes can violate scout-lane write boundaries unless run in disposable directories or paired with cleanup policy.
- Compatibility shims can blur promoted `engine.n.*` DSK APIs and legacy `engine.*` migration APIs.
- Public consumption language can overclaim if it does not distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch availability from npm registry availability.
- Proof-readiness queueing can reduce overclaiming, but it is not evidence that module-source, npm, package-version, browser, or hardening blockers are fixed.
- DSK first-wave migration proof should not be mistaken for production-hardening proof; runtime failure-boundary, lifecycle parity, query/command semantics, experience-edge, namespace/install/dependency/state/receipt/bridge/wrapper/source-state/state-signal/operations/spatial/traversal/lifecycle rows remain open.

## Blockers
- ProtoKits fetched `origin/0.0.2` needs validation in an environment that resolves `nexusrealtime`, or package/dependency metadata needs to make standalone validation possible.
- Experiments fetched `origin/0.0.2` needs targeted DSK validation with a sibling layout or revised module-source strategy.
- Public proof import-map/module source strategy remains unresolved: CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, package/workspace dependency, or build-step import mapping.
- `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` is not wired into Experiments aggregate validation or documented as a required targeted command.
- npm metadata for `nexusrealtime` is unavailable.
- Branch `0.0.2` still serves package metadata version `0.1.0`; the release/package-version policy remains unclear.
- DSK promotion hardening lacks executable fixture coverage for runtime failure-boundary rows, lifecycle parity rows, query/command semantics rows, experience-edge rows, and earlier namespace/install/dependency/state/receipt/bridge/wrapper/source-state/state-signal/operations/spatial/traversal/lifecycle rows.

## Suggested next review item
- Define one module-source strategy, then validate ProtoKits fetched-ref package resolution, Experiments fetched-ref targeted DSK smoke, and public browser loading against that same model.
