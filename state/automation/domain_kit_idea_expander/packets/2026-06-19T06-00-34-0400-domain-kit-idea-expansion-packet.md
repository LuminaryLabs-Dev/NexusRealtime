# Domain And Kit Idea Expansion Packet: 2026-06-19T06-00-34-0400

## Timestamp
- local: 2026-06-19T06-00-34-0400
- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-19-0202`.
- Latest current-lane packet added operations data integrity, immutable config, stable id allocation, finite transaction policy, restored resource state, and operations invariant proof inventory.
- Latest DSK architecture packet says current `origin/0.0.2` advanced to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`, remains test-green, and needs a concrete hardening fixture plan across namespace, install, dependency, state-contract, service-call, and operations data invariants.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet says core remains aligned and available-checkout proof smokes pass, but sibling local checkouts are behind fetched release refs and the public proof route still stalls at `Booting...`.
- Latest deep bug packet adds spatial/hazard/mobility/time invariant bugs: SpatialScale can miss anchor-entry events, ScenarioDuration zero-time gates do not settle until positive time, HazardField can duplicate generated ids, and VehicleDynamics can grant zero-capacity boost.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, source snippets, and preflight results were treated as authority for this run.

- latest remote release branch: `0.0.2`

## Ideas added
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`
  - Spatial Mobility Invariant Domain for transition-state, immediate-threshold, hazard identity, mobility resource-bound, and proof-row ownership.
- `docs/kits_ideas.md`
  - `transition-state-policy-kit`
  - `immediate-threshold-policy-kit`
  - `hazard-identity-policy-kit`
  - `resource-bound-normalization-kit`
  - `spatial-mobility-invariant-proof-kit`
- `docs/described_examples.md`
  - Spatial Mobility Invariant Harness composition joining spatial transition, zero-time threshold, hazard identity, mobility resource, and proof services.

## Ideas deferred
- Direct fixes for SpatialScaleKit, ScenarioDurationKit, HazardFieldKit, and VehicleDynamicsKit were deferred because this lane cannot edit source or tests.
- A new general Stable Identity Domain was not added because `stable-id-allocation-kit` and Operations Data Integrity Domain already cover cross-domain allocation; this run adds only hazard-specific policy and proof rows.
- A new Time Domain was not added because Simulation Time Policy Domain already exists; this run adds immediate-threshold policy for zero-time settlement.
- Public proof route import-map work was deferred because it belongs in proof/experiment lanes, not this idea lane.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate State Transition Policy Domain; the new domain focuses on proximity/transition receipts rather than terminal-state taxonomy.
- Did not duplicate Simulation Time Policy Domain; immediate threshold policy narrows to init/reset/zero-delta settlement.
- Did not duplicate Config Normalization Domain; resource-bound normalization handles capacity invariants after config values are known.
- Did not duplicate Operations Data Integrity Domain; hazard identity and mobility resource bounds are spatial/mobility concerns, not service-flow data integrity.
- Did not duplicate Proof Surface Domain or `proof-coverage-matrix-kit`; `spatial-mobility-invariant-proof-kit` narrows proof rows to transition, threshold, identity, and capacity checks.

## DSK boundary notes
- Transition-state policy should keep nearest/query state separate from entered/exited/reached/completed transition state.
- Immediate-threshold policy should decide whether zero-duration and zero-checkpoint gates settle at init, reset, or zero-delta validation ticks.
- Hazard identity should reuse general allocation policy where possible but expose hazard-specific collision attribution and proof rows.
- Resource-bound normalization should start as a ProtoKit candidate unless a shared core invariant is needed for promoted DSK fixtures.

## Open questions
- Should spatial transition policy be one standalone DSK or a required fixture section for spatial-scale, landmark, and affordance domains?
- Should zero-time thresholds emit completion receipts at initialization, reset, or only through an explicit settle call?
- Should hazard identity be a thin adapter over stable id allocation or a hazard/director-owned policy kit?
- Should zero-capacity mobility resources reject activation, clamp silently, or emit rejection receipts through accepted mutation policy?
- Should proof coverage wait for the public first-wave DSK route to load, or keep these rows local/targeted until public loading is fixed?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, or `.agent` files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route was fixed.
- No npm publication or deployment was performed.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
