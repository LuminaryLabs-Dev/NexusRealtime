# Ecosystem State Packet: 2026-06-20T01-59-37-0400

## Scope
- Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem State Packet
- Local timestamp: 2026-06-20T01-59-37-0400
- UTC timestamp: 2026-06-20T05:59:37Z
- Workspace: `/Users/crimsonwheeler/Documents/GitHub/NexusRealtime`
- Repos checked: NexusRealtime core, NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, NexusRealtime-Experiments

## Lane Goal
- Audit NexusRealtime ecosystem state, drift, and proof readiness across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, DSK promotion ledgers, branch targets, public links, and proof paths.

## Prior State Context
- Previous ecosystem root: `ecosystem-root-024`.
- Previous lesson: core was current and validation-green, while module-source strategy still blocked ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof, and public browser proof; proof-signal integrity was separate hardening inventory.
- Latest DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T22-25-35-0400` keeps proof-signal integrity as a later hardening tranche after runtime failure-boundary and other fixture queues.
- Latest ecosystem proof node `2026-06-19T22-40-52-0400` keeps local, fetched-ref, aggregate, targeted, browser, npm, package-version, hardening, and proof-signal claims separate.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-19T21-55-21-0400` remains the newest bug evidence for ARExperience receipts, hit-test rejection, negative time, and finite spatial scale.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-20T00-00-47-0400` found no new durable idea family; repeated module-source and proof-signal evidence maps to existing Proof Readiness Queue inventory.
- State packets/nodes were context only. Live source, docs, tests, git refs, public URLs, preflight, and browser launch state were treated as authority.

## Agent Workspace State
- Used agent-it mentality and read `.agent/start-here.md`, `.agent/operating-model.md`, `.agent/automation-rules.md`, `.agent/report-format.md`, `.agent/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, `.agent/CHANGE_LOG.md`, and `memory.md`.
- Used Human View Orchestration. Mandatory question: Have I checked what the human would actually see, and do I need screenshots, visual inspection, launch-state inspection, or before/after comparison to validate this properly? Answer: yes; public proof can return HTTP 200 while remaining stuck at boot.
- Used Playwright CLI wrapper for browser launch-state inspection. Snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof` and visible `Booting...`.
- Removed Playwright scratch files and disposable fetched-ref extraction folders created by this run.
- No source, tests, public docs, package metadata, deployment files, `.agent`, canonical memory, or sibling repo files were edited.

## Ecosystem Findings
- Core remains aligned with the preflight-resolved latest remote release branch `0.0.2`; `HEAD` equals `origin/0.0.2`.
- Core validation passed: `npm test` passed all 8 smoke tests.
- Required core GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links remain reachable.
- Optional npm registry metadata remains unavailable with HTTP 404, so npm-backed consumption is still not proven.
- Branch/package policy risk remains unchanged: release branch `0.0.2` serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.
- ProtoKits local checkout has moved since the prior packet but is farther behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`: local `f006fa3bbe5721b0aa073de2bca08a452bd8e492`, origin `b1d69099392a144a999cac824d344c403fe762d8`, ahead/behind `0 31`.
- ProtoKits available-checkout validation is no longer green: `npm run check` syntax-checked 330 JavaScript modules, then `smoke:imports` failed with 110 ProtoKit index import failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`; targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` failed for the same missing package.
- ProtoKits disposable fetched-ref validation remains blocked: fetched `origin/0.0.2` at `b1d69099392a144a999cac824d344c403fe762d8` syntax-checked 358 JavaScript modules, then `smoke:imports` failed with 110 import failures rooted in missing package `nexusrealtime`; targeted DSK smoke failed for the same package.
- Experiments local checkout has advanced since the prior packet but is still behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`: local `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb`, origin `eaeec53bc44e13136e18af37ed4c3f0755b57e60`, ahead/behind `0 3`.
- Experiments local targeted DSK validation is no longer green: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed because local ProtoKits `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js` could not resolve package `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref aggregate validation still passed: `npm run check` generated 100 flat route wrappers and passed the aggregate smoke chain.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref targeted DSK validation still failed: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` could not resolve `/private/tmp/NexusRealtime/src/index.js` from sibling-relative proof imports.
- Public DSK proof remains HTTP-visible but not browser-complete: Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof` and visible `Booting...`; console showed 404s for deployed sibling module paths.
- Local proof route files still use sibling-relative imports: import map `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, proof import `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, and ProtoKits imports under `../../../../NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/...`.

## Domain And Kit Expansion Signals
- Core/ProtoKits/Experiments ownership remains stable: core owns runtime/DSK/composer primitives, ProtoKits owns reusable implementations, and Experiments owns playable/browser proof.
- `docs/described_examples.md`, `docs/domain_ideas.md`, and `docs/kits_ideas.md` already contain Proof Readiness Queue and Proof Signal Integrity inventory.
- Latest domain idea node found no non-duplicative durable idea family; module-source, fetched-ref, public browser, package-version, and aggregate-vs-targeted proof signals should refine existing proof-readiness inventory rather than add a new domain.
- These planning rows do not fix the live package resolution, sibling import, public browser import, npm metadata, or package-version-policy blockers.

## Evidence
- `npm run automation:preflight` passed and resolved latest branch `0.0.2`.
- Core `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2` returned `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0` for both refs.
- Core `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2` returned `0 0`.
- Core `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
- ProtoKits `git fetch --prune origin`, status, rev-parse, and ahead/behind checks showed local `f006fa3`, origin `b1d6909`, and ahead/behind `0 31`.
- ProtoKits local `npm run check` failed after 330 syntax-checked modules; `smoke:imports` reported 110 import failures rooted in missing package `nexusrealtime`.
- ProtoKits local `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
- ProtoKits disposable extracted `origin/0.0.2` at `b1d69099392a144a999cac824d344c403fe762d8` failed aggregate and targeted checks on missing package `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments `git fetch --prune origin`, status, rev-parse, and ahead/behind checks showed local `799fad8`, origin `eaeec53`, and ahead/behind `0 3`.
- Experiments local `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime` from local ProtoKits `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js`.
- Experiments disposable extracted `origin/0.0.2` at `eaeec53bc44e13136e18af37ed4c3f0755b57e60` passed `npm run check` and failed targeted DSK smoke on missing sibling `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
- Curl checks confirmed proof route/raw/CDN files remain public, while runtime dependency paths used by the public page remain 404.
- Playwright CLI opened the public DSK proof route; snapshot showed `Booting...`; console log showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.

## Suggested Canonical Updates
- Pick one module-source strategy for release proof: package/workspace dependency, CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or build-step import maps.
- Make local available-checkout validation use the same `nexusrealtime` resolution model as fetched-ref and public proof; local ProtoKits and local Experiments targeted proof are now failing too.
- Validate ProtoKits fetched `origin/0.0.2` with the chosen `nexusrealtime` resolution model before claiming latest-ref ProtoKits proof.
- Validate Experiments fetched `origin/0.0.2` targeted DSK smoke with the same model intended for public proof.
- Wire `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` into aggregate Experiments validation or document it as required targeted evidence.
- Update public consumption wording or release policy so docs distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch consumption from unavailable npm registry metadata.
- Decide whether branch `0.0.2` serving package version `0.1.0` is intentional policy or stale metadata.
- Keep proof-signal integrity rows as executable hardening inventory separate from public module-loading proof.

## Knowledge Nodes
- Wrote `state/automation/ecosystem_state_scout/knowledge_nodes/2026-06-20T01-59-37-0400-ecosystem-state-node.md`.
- New root lesson: core remains current and validation-green, but ecosystem proof readiness regressed because local available-checkout DSK proof now fails on the same unresolved `nexusrealtime` package resolution that blocks ProtoKits fetched-ref proof; public browser proof remains stuck on sibling module 404s.

## Master Tracker Updates
- Added `ecosystem-root-025`.
- Marked `ecosystem-root-024` as superseded by `ecosystem-root-025`.
- Added child branches for local available-checkout proof regression, ProtoKits latest-ref drift, Experiments targeted DSK regression, public proof import shape, module-source strategy, and proof-readiness queue boundaries.
