# Domain And Kit Idea Expansion Packet: 2026-06-20T18-00-21-0400

## Timestamp
- local: 2026-06-20T18-00-21-0400
- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-20-1737`.
- Latest current-lane packet found no non-duplicative idea family before the new deep-bug packet, because procedural/navigation ownership, scheduler/world mutation, and proof-readiness rows were already covered.
- Latest DSK architecture packet `2026-06-20T17-38-41-0400` kept runtime failure-boundary, scheduler/world mutation, and procedural/navigation ownership in the core validation hardening queue.
- Latest ecosystem state/proof packets kept module-source, npm, public browser proof, package-version, and aggregate-vs-targeted proof separate from runtime hardening.
- Latest deep bug packet `2026-06-20T17-54-14-0400` added fresh evidence around Telemetry live selected values/path selectors plus RequestQueue, TransportRoute, and InputIntent command metadata/state ownership.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, lane prompt, preflight, tracker state, duplicate scan, and boundary docs were treated as authority for this run.

## Ideas added
- Added Telemetry Command Evidence Ownership Domain to `docs/domain_ideas.md`.
- Added `telemetry-selected-value-snapshot-kit`, `telemetry-path-selector-isolation-kit`, `service-command-payload-ownership-kit`, `input-frame-ownership-kit`, and `telemetry-command-evidence-proof-kit` to `docs/kits_ideas.md`.
- Added Telemetry Command Evidence Ownership Harness to `docs/described_examples.md`.

## Ideas deferred
- Source fixes, fixtures, and implementation work were deferred because this lane is planning inventory only.
- Public module-source, npm, package-version, aggregate-vs-targeted, and browser proof blockers remain Proof Readiness Queue work.
- Low-level `world.readEvents()` payload isolation remains Scheduler World Mutation Isolation work.
- Procedural/navigation command and snapshot ownership remains under Procedural Navigation State Ownership.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate Query Read Model Isolation because the new row targets telemetry-selected values and command submission boundaries, not read-only query helper outputs.
- Did not duplicate Procedural Navigation State Ownership because the new row targets Telemetry, RequestQueue, TransportRoute, and InputIntent rather than generated-world/pathfinding APIs.
- Did not duplicate Scheduler World Mutation Isolation because the new row targets public service command and telemetry evidence boundaries rather than low-level scheduler/world event queues.
- Did not create narrow one-off Telemetry, RequestQueue, TransportRoute, or InputIntent domains because the cross-cutting reusable family is command/evidence ownership.

## DSK boundary notes
- Existing boundaries still hold: NexusRealtime core owns runtime, ECS, scheduler, DSK/composer primitives, existing core command APIs, and validation surfaces.
- New reusable gameplay/domain implementations remain out of NexusRealtime core and should target NexusRealtime-ProtoKits by default.
- The new rows are core validation-surface inventory for existing telemetry, operations, transport, and input APIs, plus ProtoKits proof tooling for future service commands.
- New browser/playable proof routes remain NexusRealtime-Experiments work.

## Open questions
- Should telemetry proof records clone on capture, clone on read, freeze, or use a combined clone/freeze policy?
- Which existing command APIs should return immutable summaries versus documented mutable handles?
- Should a non-scout fixture tranche cover telemetry selected values, operations command metadata, and input frames together or split them after scheduler/world and procedural/navigation hardening?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, `.agent` files, ProtoKits, or Experiments files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route, fetched-ref proof, module-source strategy, package-version policy, or npm metadata was fixed.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
