# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem proof scout 2026-06-19T13-40-31-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-proof-015
- statement: Core and local available-checkout DSK proof remain green, but the latest proof blockers are still module-source gates: ProtoKits fetched-ref proof cannot resolve package `nexusrealtime`, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof cannot resolve sibling `NexusRealtime`, and public browser proof remains stuck at `Booting...` on deployed sibling module 404s.
- why it matters: Promotion review must not merge local checkout success, fetched release-ref validation, aggregate checks, targeted DSK checks, browser-complete public proof, npm availability, and runtime hardening into one proof claim.

## Child Nodes
- id: ecosystem-proof-015-a
  parent: ecosystem-proof-015
  lesson: Core still matches the preflight-resolved latest release branch and passes its smoke suite.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ahead/behind `0 0`; `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
  look further: Keep resolving latest release refs every run because sibling refs continue to drift.
- id: ecosystem-proof-015-b
  parent: ecosystem-proof-015
  lesson: ProtoKits local available-checkout proof is green, but fetched latest-ref aggregate and targeted DSK proof remain blocked by package resolution.
  evidence: Local ProtoKits `npm run check` and `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed at `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`; disposable `origin/0.0.2` at `06f5f3bd35e3b4c2c24d49d4affbe026b0d92c8f` failed import smoke with 110 failures and targeted DSK smoke with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
  look further: Validate fetched ProtoKits with a package, workspace, CDN, or link model that matches intended consumption.
- id: ecosystem-proof-015-c
  parent: ecosystem-proof-015
  lesson: Experiments fetched-ref aggregate check can pass while targeted DSK proof still fails.
  evidence: Disposable Experiments `origin/0.0.2` at `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb` passed `npm run check`; targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed because `src/proof.js` resolved `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js` to missing `/private/tmp/.../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  look further: Wire the DSK smoke into aggregate validation or document the required sibling/module setup.
- id: ecosystem-proof-015-d
  parent: ecosystem-proof-015
  lesson: Public DSK proof remains HTTP-visible but browser-stuck at `Booting...`.
  evidence: Curl returned 200 for the route; Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof` plus `Booting...`; console and request output showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.
  look further: Do not treat HTTP 200 on the route as browser-complete proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-015-e
  parent: ecosystem-proof-015
  lesson: The same unresolved module-source strategy blocks fetched-ref and public proof surfaces.
  evidence: ProtoKits failed on package-name `nexusrealtime`; Experiments targeted proof failed on missing sibling `NexusRealtime`; public route failed on deployed sibling module 404s.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, workspace/package dependency, or a build-step import map.
- id: ecosystem-proof-015-f
  parent: ecosystem-proof-015
  lesson: Fetched Experiments aggregate proof reflects tropical-island-scene but still omits DSK first-wave proof.
  evidence: Fetched `package.json` includes `tests/tropical-island-scene-static-smoke.mjs`; local `package.json` includes `tests/fluid-water-lab-static-smoke.mjs`; neither aggregate `check` script lists `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
  look further: Keep aggregate proof and targeted DSK proof distinct until the script or release checklist makes the DSK smoke explicit.
- id: ecosystem-proof-015-g
  parent: ecosystem-proof-015
  lesson: Traversal proof integrity rows now join runtime proof boundaries but stay separate from public route loading and package validation.
  evidence: DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T13-24-43-0400`, deep bug node `2026-06-19T12-54-22-0400`, and domain idea node `2026-06-19T13-01-05-0400` add traversal cost policy, navmesh identity, procedural signature taxonomy, and recovery receipt/state rows.
  look further: Route these rows to executable hardening fixtures before broad DSK promotion claims.
- id: ecosystem-proof-015-h
  parent: ecosystem-proof-015
  lesson: Core/ProtoKits/Experiments ownership docs still point reusable implementation to ProtoKits and browser proof routing to Experiments, not core.
  evidence: `docs/how-to-protokit.md`, `docs/how-to-experiment.md`, `docs/protokit-boundaries.md`, and `docs/protokit-experiment-loop.md` keep core as runtime/DSK/composer owner, ProtoKits as reusable implementation owner, and Experiments as playable/browser proof owner.
  look further: Fix proof routing/imports without moving route ownership or reusable implementation into NexusRealtime core.
