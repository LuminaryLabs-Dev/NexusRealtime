# Ecosystem State Packet: 2026-06-19T22-10-08-0400

## Scope
- Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem State Packet
- Local timestamp: 2026-06-19T22-10-08-0400
- UTC timestamp: 2026-06-20T02:10:08Z
- Workspace: `/Users/crimsonwheeler/Documents/GitHub/NexusRealtime`
- Repos checked: core NexusRealtime, sibling NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, sibling NexusRealtime-Experiments

## Lane Goal
- Audit NexusRealtime ecosystem state, drift, and proof readiness across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, DSK promotion ledgers, branch targets, public links, and proof paths.

## Prior State Context
- Previous ecosystem root: `ecosystem-root-023`.
- Previous lesson: core was current and smoke-green; sibling drift was unchanged; module-source strategy still blocked ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments targeted fetched-ref proof, and public browser proof; AR/spatial read-model rows were hardening inventory.
- Latest DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T21-25-07-0400` keeps runtime failure-boundary first and treats AR/spatial read-model as a later tranche.
- Latest ecosystem proof node `2026-06-19T21-41-45-0400` confirms local-green/public-failing proof and keeps fetched-ref, aggregate, targeted, browser, npm, package-version, and hardening claims separate.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-19T21-55-21-0400` adds proof-signal rows: repeated ARExperience terminal completion, hit-test source rejection, negative tick time, and non-finite greybox/spatial scale.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-19T22-01-38-0400` converts those rows into proof-signal integrity planning inventory.
- State packets and nodes were context only. Live source, docs, tests, git refs, public URLs, preflight, and Playwright launch state were treated as authority.

## Agent Workspace State
- Used agent-it mentality and read `.agent/start-here.md`, `.agent/operating-model.md`, `.agent/automation-rules.md`, `.agent/report-format.md`, `.agent/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, `.agent/CHANGE_LOG.md`, and `memory.md`.
- Human-view question: Have I checked what the human would actually see, and do I need screenshots, visual inspection, launch-state inspection, or before/after comparison to validate this properly? Answer: yes. The public proof route is user-visible, so launch-state inspection was required.
- Used Playwright CLI wrapper for human-visible inspection of the public proof route. The page remained visible but stuck at `Booting...`.
- Removed Playwright scratch files created by this run.
- No source, tests, public docs, package metadata, `.agent`, canonical memory, sibling repo files, or deployment files were edited.

- Disposable extracted sibling `origin/0.0.2` trees under `/tmp/`

## Ecosystem Findings
- Core remains aligned with latest remote release branch `0.0.2`; `HEAD` equals `origin/0.0.2`.
- Core validation passed: `npm test` passed all 8 smoke tests.
- Required core GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links remain reachable.
- Optional npm registry metadata remains unavailable with HTTP 404, so npm-backed consumption is still not proven.
- ProtoKits local available checkout remains behind fetched `origin/0.0.2` by 26 commits: local `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`, origin `f0fa45a75eea2c4b88683fe3bf146b0453812820`.
- ProtoKits available-checkout validation passed: `npm run check` checked 294 JavaScript modules, imported 236 ProtoKit index modules, and passed the smoke chain; `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed.
- ProtoKits disposable fetched-ref validation still fails: `npm run check` checked 311 JavaScript modules, then `smoke:imports` failed with 110 import failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`; targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` failed for the same missing package.
- Experiments local available checkout remains behind fetched `origin/0.0.2` by 24 commits: local `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f`, origin `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb`.
- Experiments local targeted DSK validation passed: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref aggregate validation passed: `npm run check` generated 100 flat route wrappers and passed its aggregate smoke chain.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref targeted DSK validation failed: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` could not resolve `/private/tmp/NexusRealtime/src/index.js` from sibling-relative proof imports.
- Public DSK proof remains HTTP-visible but not browser-complete: Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof` and visible `Booting...`; console showed 404s for deployed sibling module paths.
- Local proof route files still use sibling-relative imports: import map `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, proof import `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, and ProtoKits imports under `../../../../NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/...`.
- Branch/package policy risk remains unchanged: release branch `0.0.2` serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.

## Domain And Kit Expansion Signals
- Current DSK core still exports `defineDomainServiceKit()`, `createDomainServiceToken()`, validation helpers, `createRealtimeGame()`, and RuntimeKit primitives from `src/index.js`.
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md` and `docs/how-to-experiment.md` keep ownership boundaries stable: core owns runtime/DSK/composer primitives, ProtoKits owns reusable implementations, and Experiments owns playable/browser proof.
- New neighboring proof-signal integrity inventory is present in `docs/described_examples.md`, `docs/domain_ideas.md`, and `docs/kits_ideas.md`.
- Proof-signal integrity rows cover ARExperience receipt idempotency, WebXR hit-test failure policy, monotonic tick time, finite spatial scale, and combined proof-signal rows.
- These rows are runtime hardening and evidence-quality inventory. They do not fix the shared module-source blocker for ProtoKits fetched-ref validation, Experiments targeted fetched-ref validation, or public browser proof.

## Evidence
- `npm run automation:preflight` passed and resolved latest branch `0.0.2`.
- Core `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2` returned `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0` for both refs.
- Core `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2` returned `0 0`.
- Core `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
- ProtoKits `git fetch --prune origin`, status, rev-parse, and ahead/behind checks showed local checkout behind fetched `origin/0.0.2` by 26 commits.
- ProtoKits available-checkout `npm run check` and `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed.
- ProtoKits disposable extracted `origin/0.0.2` at `f0fa45a75eea2c4b88683fe3bf146b0453812820` failed aggregate and targeted checks on missing package `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments `git fetch --prune origin`, status, rev-parse, and ahead/behind checks showed local checkout behind fetched `origin/0.0.2` by 24 commits.
- Experiments available-checkout `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed.
- Experiments disposable extracted `origin/0.0.2` at `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb` passed `npm run check` and failed targeted DSK smoke on missing sibling `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
- Curl checks confirmed required proof raw files and ProtoKits ledger are public, while runtime dependency paths used by the public page remain 404.
- Playwright CLI opened the public DSK proof route; snapshot showed `Booting...`; console log showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.
- `rg` over docs/source confirmed proof-signal integrity additions and their source targets: `src/ar-experience-kit.js`, `src/ar-session.js`, `src/engine.js`, `src/greybox-building-kit.js`, and `src/spatial-room-kit.js`.

## Suggested Canonical Updates
- Define one module-source strategy for proof and release validation: package/workspace dependency, CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or build-step import map.
- Validate ProtoKits fetched `origin/0.0.2` with the chosen `nexusrealtime` resolution model before claiming latest-ref ProtoKits proof.
- Validate Experiments fetched `origin/0.0.2` targeted DSK smoke with the same module-source model intended for public proof.
- Wire `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` into aggregate Experiments validation or document it as required targeted evidence.
- Update public consumption wording or release policy so docs distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch consumption from unavailable npm registry metadata.
- Decide whether branch `0.0.2` serving package version `0.1.0` is intentional policy or stale metadata.
- Route proof-signal integrity rows into executable fixtures separately from public module-loading proof.

## Knowledge Nodes
- Wrote `state/automation/ecosystem_state_scout/knowledge_nodes/2026-06-19T22-10-08-0400-ecosystem-state-node.md`.
- New root lesson: core remains current and validation-green, but distribution proof is unchanged; one module-source strategy still blocks fetched-ref and public proof, while proof-signal integrity is a separate hardening tranche.

## Master Tracker Updates
- Added `ecosystem-root-024`.
- Marked `ecosystem-root-023` as superseded by `ecosystem-root-024`.
- Added child branches for module-source strategy, ProtoKits fetched-ref drift, Experiments targeted fetched-ref proof, public proof import shape, and proof-signal integrity hardening.
