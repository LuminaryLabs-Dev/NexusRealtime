# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem_state_scout 2026-06-20T04-10-40-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-root-027
- statement: Core remains current and smoke-green, but ecosystem proof is still blocked by one module-source strategy: ProtoKits local and fetched validation cannot resolve package `nexusrealtime`, local Experiments targeted proof fails through ProtoKits, fetched Experiments targeted proof still assumes sibling `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, and public browser proof still stalls at `Booting...`.
- why it matters: Promotion review still cannot merge local, fetched-ref, aggregate, targeted, browser, npm, package-version, and hardening claims into one proof. ProtoKits latest release ref advanced again to `82c879f`, while new Fishing/content-boundary rows are validation inventory rather than a module-source fix.

## Child Nodes
- id: core-current-2026-06-20-0410
  parent: ecosystem-root-027
  lesson: Core still matches the preflight-resolved latest release branch and passes its smoke suite.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ahead/behind was `0 0`; `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
  look further: Continue resolving latest release branch with preflight every run.
- id: protokits-latest-ref-drift-2026-06-20-0410
  parent: ecosystem-root-027
  lesson: ProtoKits fetched latest release ref advanced again and remains unvalidated because package `nexusrealtime` is unresolved.
  evidence: Local ProtoKits `HEAD` was `ee9e964b64b4202072528ff70ebc31c488983fae`; fetched `origin/0.0.2` advanced to `82c879f48d9a35db520015a7b219da8c349d7fd9`; ahead/behind was `0 7`; disposable fetched-ref `npm run check` syntax-checked 370 JavaScript modules and failed with 110 import failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`; targeted DSK smoke failed for the same package.
  look further: Validate fetched ProtoKits with the same package, workspace, CDN, or link model selected for local and public proof.
- id: local-available-checkout-regression-2026-06-20-0410
  parent: ecosystem-root-027
  lesson: Local available-checkout DSK proof remains red because package `nexusrealtime` is not resolvable from ProtoKits.
  evidence: ProtoKits local `npm run check` failed after 367 syntax-checked modules with 110 import-smoke failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`; ProtoKits local `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` failed for the same package; Experiments local `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed through local ProtoKits `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js` for the same package.
  look further: Make local workspace/package resolution explicit before treating available-checkout proof as evidence.
- id: experiments-targeted-fetched-ref-resolution-2026-06-20-0410
  parent: ecosystem-root-027
  lesson: Experiments fetched aggregate proof still passes while targeted DSK proof remains blocked by sibling-relative imports.
  evidence: Local Experiments `HEAD` was `57b3d668891794ddad00c765ce4faf342a3d9000`; fetched `origin/0.0.2` was `3e047f693f3ed58cab1c362deb09a597398d05e5`; ahead/behind was `0 2`; disposable fetched-ref `npm run check` generated 100 flat route wrappers and passed; targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed because `src/proof.js` resolved `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js` to a missing sibling path under the temp extraction parent.
  look further: Run targeted DSK proof with the same module-source strategy intended for public proof.
- id: public-proof-import-shape-2026-06-20-0410
  parent: ecosystem-root-027
  lesson: The public DSK proof route remains HTTP-visible but browser-stuck at `Booting...`.
  evidence: Fetch returned 200 for the proof route; Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and `Booting...`; console and request history showed 404s for `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`, and `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or a build-step import map for the public proof route.
- id: aggregate-targeted-proof-boundary-2026-06-20-0410
  parent: ecosystem-root-027
  lesson: Experiments aggregate validation is green but still separate from DSK first-wave targeted proof.
  evidence: Disposable fetched Experiments `npm run check` passed, but `package.json` aggregate script does not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`; both local and fetched targeted DSK smoke commands failed.
  look further: Decide whether the DSK first-wave proof smoke belongs in `npm run check`, `npm run check:deploy`, or a required targeted evidence checklist.
- id: package-version-policy-2026-06-20-0410
  parent: ecosystem-root-027
  lesson: Package version signals remain split across branch names and package metadata.
  evidence: Core release branch `0.0.2` serves `nexusrealtime@0.1.0`; local ProtoKits package metadata is `0.0.1`; fetched ProtoKits `origin/0.0.2` package metadata runs as `0.0.2`; npm metadata for `nexusrealtime` remains 404.
  look further: Branch naming policy, package version policy, public consumption wording, and npm publication policy.
- id: content-boundary-hardening-separate-2026-06-20-0410
  parent: ecosystem-root-027
  lesson: Fishing/ReefRescue content-boundary and objective-contract rows are real validation inventory, not distribution proof fixes.
  evidence: Deep bug node `2026-06-20T03-55-08-0400` and domain idea node `2026-06-20T04-01-35-0400` add product-themed core export, fixed FishingKit id, zero/negative objective completion, and content dataset validation rows; public/local/fetched DSK proof still fails on module-source resolution.
  look further: Route content-boundary fixtures separately from module-source/public browser proof work.
