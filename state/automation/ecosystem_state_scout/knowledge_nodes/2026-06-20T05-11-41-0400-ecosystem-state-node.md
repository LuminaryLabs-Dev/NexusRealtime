# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem_state_scout 2026-06-20T05-11-41-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-root-028
- statement: Core and ProtoKits now both match the preflight-resolved latest release branch refs, but ecosystem proof is still blocked by module-source strategy: ProtoKits local/fetched validation cannot resolve package `nexusrealtime`, local Experiments targeted proof fails through ProtoKits, fetched Experiments targeted proof assumes sibling `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, and public browser proof still stalls at `Booting...`.
- why it matters: ProtoKits ref drift and local package metadata mismatch are no longer the active blocker, but promotion review still cannot merge local, fetched-ref, aggregate, targeted, browser, npm, package-version, and hardening claims into one proof.

## Child Nodes
- id: core-current-2026-06-20-0511
  parent: ecosystem-root-028
  lesson: Core still matches the preflight-resolved latest release branch and passes its smoke suite.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ahead/behind was `0 0`; `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
  look further: Continue resolving latest release branch with preflight every run.
- id: protokits-ref-aligned-package-resolution-2026-06-20-0511
  parent: ecosystem-root-028
  lesson: ProtoKits latest-ref drift closed, but package resolution still blocks local and fetched validation.
  evidence: Local ProtoKits `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `3d42b725dd166274ff6c5452beef86ef17863852`; ahead/behind was `0 0`; package metadata was `@luminarylabs/nexusrealtime-protokits@0.0.2`; local and disposable fetched `npm run check` both failed after 370 syntax-checked modules with 110 import failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`; local and fetched targeted DSK smoke failed for the same package.
  look further: Validate ProtoKits with the same package, workspace, CDN, or link model selected for local and public proof.
- id: experiments-targeted-proof-still-red-2026-06-20-0511
  parent: ecosystem-root-028
  lesson: Experiments fetched aggregate proof still passes while local and fetched targeted DSK proof remain blocked.
  evidence: Local Experiments `HEAD` was `57b3d668891794ddad00c765ce4faf342a3d9000`; fetched `origin/0.0.2` was `3e047f693f3ed58cab1c362deb09a597398d05e5`; ahead/behind was `0 2`; local targeted smoke failed through ProtoKits missing package `nexusrealtime`; disposable fetched `npm run check` generated 100 flat route wrappers and passed; fetched targeted smoke failed because `src/proof.js` resolved `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js` to a missing sibling path under the temp extraction parent.
  look further: Run targeted DSK proof with the same module-source strategy intended for public proof.
- id: public-proof-import-shape-2026-06-20-0511
  parent: ecosystem-root-028
  lesson: The public DSK proof route remains HTTP-visible but browser-stuck at `Booting...`.
  evidence: Fetch returned 200 for the proof route; Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and visible `Booting...`; console history showed 404s for `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`, and `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or a build-step import map for the public proof route.
- id: aggregate-targeted-proof-boundary-2026-06-20-0511
  parent: ecosystem-root-028
  lesson: Experiments aggregate validation is green but still separate from DSK first-wave targeted proof.
  evidence: Disposable fetched Experiments `npm run check` passed, but `package.json` aggregate script does not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`; both local and fetched targeted DSK smoke commands failed.
  look further: Decide whether the DSK first-wave proof smoke belongs in `npm run check`, `npm run check:deploy`, or a required targeted evidence checklist.
- id: public-consumption-version-policy-2026-06-20-0511
  parent: ecosystem-root-028
  lesson: Public consumption and version policy remain split even after ProtoKits metadata alignment.
  evidence: Core release branch `0.0.2` serves `nexusrealtime@0.1.0`; npm metadata for `nexusrealtime` remains 404; ProtoKits local/fetched metadata now reports `0.0.2`, but validation is still red.
  look further: Branch naming policy, package version policy, public consumption wording, and npm publication policy.
- id: query-read-model-hardening-separate-2026-06-20-0511
  parent: ecosystem-root-028
  lesson: Query read-model isolation is real hardening inventory, not a distribution proof fix.
  evidence: Deep bug node `2026-06-20T04-54-16-0400` and domain idea node `2026-06-20T05-02-13-0400` add public query helper, engine read-method, nested metadata/hazard, and stored query proof snapshot rows; public/local/fetched DSK proof still fails on module-source resolution.
  look further: Route read-model fixtures separately from module-source/public browser proof work.
