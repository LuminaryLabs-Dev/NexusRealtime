# Ecosystem State Packet: 2026-06-19T06-09-33-0400

## Scope
- Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem State Packet
- Local timestamp: 2026-06-19T06-09-33-0400
- UTC timestamp: 2026-06-19T10:09:33Z
- Workspace: `/Users/crimsonwheeler/Documents/GitHub/NexusRealtime`
- Repos checked: core NexusRealtime, sibling NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, sibling NexusRealtime-Experiments

## Lane Goal
- Audit NexusRealtime ecosystem state, drift, and proof readiness across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, DSK promotion ledgers, branch targets, public links, and proof paths.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `ecosystem-root-007`.
- Prior ecosystem state packet `2026-06-19T01-11-04-0400` said core and sibling release `HEAD`s were aligned and validation-green, but sibling worktree dirt had reappeared while public proof loading, aggregate DSK proof coverage, npm metadata, and branch/package version policy remained open.
- Neighboring DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T05-40-58-0400` says current `origin/0.0.2` advanced to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0` and DSK promotion is now blocked by a concrete hardening fixture plan across namespace, install, dependency, state-contract, service-call, and operations data invariants.
- Neighboring ecosystem proof node `2026-06-19T05-42-20-0400` says local-targeted proof remains green and public-browser proof remains blocked, but fetched sibling release refs advanced beyond the available local checkouts.
- Neighboring deep bug node `2026-06-19T05-53-25-0400` adds spatial, hazard, mobility, and scenario-time invariant bugs.
- Neighboring domain idea node `2026-06-19T06-00-34-0400` maps those bugs into spatial and mobility invariant planning inventory.
- These state packets were used for context only. Live source, docs, tests, fetched refs, preflight, public URLs, and Playwright output are authority for this run.

## Agent Workspace State
- `.agent/start-here.md`, `.agent/operating-model.md`, `.agent/automation-rules.md`, `.agent/report-format.md`, `.agent/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, and `.agent/CHANGE_LOG.md` were read.
- `.agent` guidance says to use live checkout evidence, resolve the latest release branch, run preflight, and keep scout outputs lane-local.
- Repo `memory.md` still says scout automations must start with preflight, resolve the latest remote release branch, check public links, and write only lane-local packets, knowledge nodes, and tracker updates.
- Human-view question answered: yes, the public proof route has a browser-visible outcome, so Playwright snapshot and screenshot capture were used. The visible state remained `Booting...`.
- Temporary Playwright scratch under `.playwright-cli/` was removed after reading the snapshot, screenshot path, and console log.
- No `.agent`, source, tests, public docs, package metadata, deployment, or repo memory files were edited by this run.

## Latest Branch Preflight
- Command: `npm run automation:preflight`
- Result: pass
- Preflight timestamp: `2026-06-19T10:06:58.320Z`
- Latest remote release branch: `0.0.2`
- Compare target: `0.0.2`
- Current branch: `0.0.2`
- Branch status: `current-is-latest-release-branch`
- Remote branches observed by preflight: `0.0.1`, `0.0.2`, `main`
- Core `HEAD`: `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`
- Core `origin/0.0.2`: `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`
- Core ahead/behind against `origin/0.0.2`: `0 0`
- Core package metadata remains `nexusrealtime@0.1.0`.
- Core worktree still has pre-existing modified/untracked neighboring automation and planning docs. This lane only adds the new ecosystem-state packet/node and tracker update.

## Ecosystem Findings
- Core remains aligned with the latest remote release branch `0.0.2`; `HEAD` equals `origin/0.0.2` at `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`.
- Older ecosystem state packets cited core release head `aba770f25e9ac0dcb5f440c3f79ae7140f0a8c0a`; this run revalidated against the current release head.
- Core validation passed: `npm test` passed all 8 smoke tests.
- Required public core links remain reachable through GitHub, raw GitHub, and jsDelivr.
- Optional npm registry metadata remains unavailable with HTTP 404, so npm-backed public consumption is still not proven.
- ProtoKits local checkout is clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`: local `8c1c933e5dc21cab0579dc3ae806341413f18b00`, origin `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`, ahead/behind `0 22`.
- Experiments local checkout is clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`: local `b4d48101ec599ae9ca2998734040874f377c8108`, origin `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f`, ahead/behind `0 33`.
- Available-checkout validation still passed:
  - Core `npm test`
  - ProtoKits `npm run check`
  - ProtoKits `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs`
  - Experiments `npm run check`
  - Experiments `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`
- Because sibling checkouts are behind fetched release refs, those local validation passes are not latest-sibling-release-ref validation.
- Fetched ProtoKits `origin/0.0.2` includes expanded domain/fluid/water surfaces, while public raw `DSK-FIRST-WAVE-LEDGER.md` still lists seven first-wave `promoted-candidate` kits and defers core promotion.
- Fetched Experiments `origin/0.0.2` aggregate `check` adds `generate:flat-routes`, high-fidelity meadow, fluid-water-lab, and flat-route smokes, but still does not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- Public DSK proof route is still HTTP-visible but not browser-ready: Playwright snapshot showed heading text plus `Booting...`, and console errors showed missing GitHub Pages module paths for NexusRealtime and ProtoKits.
- Fetched Experiments proof files still use sibling relative imports that map to missing GitHub Pages paths.
- Branch/version policy risk remains unchanged: release branch `0.0.2` serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.

## Domain And Kit Expansion Signals
- Current DSK core still exports `defineDomainServiceKit()`, `createDomainServiceToken()`, validation helpers, `createRealtimeGame()`, and runtime-kit primitives from `src/index.js`.
- Domain/kit idea docs continue to describe planning inventory, not implementation ledger or release contract.
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md` and `docs/how-to-experiment.md` continue to keep the ecosystem boundary explicit: core owns runtime/DSK/composer primitives, ProtoKits owns reusable domain kit implementations, and Experiments owns playable/browser proofs.
- Neighboring architecture, bug, proof, and idea lanes now converge on two separate blockers:
  - distribution/proof readiness: sibling latest-ref validation, public proof module loading, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy.
  - DSK promotion readiness: namespace safety, install transactions, dependency policy, state contracts, service-call policy, operations data integrity, spatial transition state, immediate thresholds, stable generated ids, and resource-bound normalization.
- Proof coverage should remain separated by category: local command, available-checkout command, latest-fetched-ref command, aggregate command, raw-public file, CDN import, npm availability, and browser-complete human proof.

## Evidence
- `npm run automation:preflight` passed and resolved latest branch `0.0.2`.
- `git status --short --branch` in core showed `## 0.0.2...origin/0.0.2` plus pre-existing automation/doc dirt.
- `git rev-parse HEAD`, `git rev-parse origin/0.0.2`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2` showed core is at `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0` with ahead/behind `0 0`.
- `npm test` in core passed 8 smoke tests.
- Sibling branch checks showed ProtoKits and Experiments local checkouts are clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`.
- ProtoKits `npm run check` passed on the available local checkout.
- ProtoKits `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed on the available local checkout.
- Experiments `npm run check` passed on the available local checkout with existing static smoke warnings.
- Experiments `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed on the available local checkout.
- `git show origin/0.0.2:package.json` showed fetched Experiments aggregate `check` still omits `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- `git diff --stat HEAD..origin/0.0.2` showed fetched ProtoKits has 22 files changed and fetched Experiments has 21 files changed beyond local checkout.
- Direct curl checks confirmed required proof raw files and ProtoKits ledger are public, while runtime dependency paths used by the public page are 404.
- Playwright opened the public DSK proof route; snapshot showed `Booting...`; console log showed 404s for deployed sibling module paths. A screenshot was captured and scratch artifacts were removed.

## Suggested Canonical Updates
- Replace the older sibling worktree dirt concern with a fresher sibling latest-ref validation gate: local sibling checkouts are clean, but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`.
- Fast-forward or separately validate ProtoKits and Experiments at fetched `origin/0.0.2` before claiming latest sibling release-ref validation.
- Keep public proof route work focused on module-source resolution: CDN `0.0.2`, deployed same-origin assets, or a build-step import map.
- Wire `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` into an aggregate Experiments validation command or document it as required targeted evidence.
- Update public consumption wording or release policy so docs distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch consumption from unavailable npm registry metadata.
- Decide whether branch `0.0.2` serving package version `0.1.0` is intentional policy or stale release metadata.
- Keep DSK expansion claims advisory until hardening fixtures and spatial/mobility invariant rows have executable proof.

## Knowledge Nodes
- Wrote `state/automation/ecosystem_state_scout/knowledge_nodes/2026-06-19T06-09-33-0400-ecosystem-state-node.md`.
- New root lesson: core is current on the latest release branch and local available-checkout proof passes, but sibling repos are behind fetched release refs while public browser proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy, and DSK hardening gates remain open.

## Master Tracker Updates
- Added `ecosystem-root-008`.
- Marked `ecosystem-root-007` as superseded by `ecosystem-root-008`.
- Added child branches for core release head drift, sibling latest-ref validation, public proof import shape, aggregate DSK proof validation, expanded ProtoKits proof coverage, public npm gap, package-version policy, and DSK hardening proof gates.
- Replaced the high-priority `sibling-worktree-dirt` open branch with `sibling-latest-ref-validation`.
