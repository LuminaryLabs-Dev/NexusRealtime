# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem proof scout 2026-06-20T05-39-53-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-proof-029
- statement: Core still matches the preflight-resolved latest release branch and passes smoke tests, and ProtoKits now also matches fetched `origin/0.0.2`, but first-wave DSK proof remains blocked by the same module-source strategy gap: ProtoKits cannot resolve package `nexusrealtime`, Experiments targeted proof fails, and the public browser proof remains stuck at `Booting...`.
- why it matters: ProtoKits ref drift is no longer an active proof blocker, but promotion review still cannot merge local, fetched-ref, aggregate, targeted, browser, npm, and package-version claims into one proof. The blocker has narrowed to a package/workspace/CDN/same-origin module-source decision that must work consistently across ProtoKits, Experiments, and public routes.

## Child Nodes
- id: ecosystem-proof-029-a
  parent: ecosystem-proof-029
  lesson: Core remains latest-release aligned and smoke-green.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` is `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0` on branch `0.0.2`; `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
  look further: Keep resolving latest release refs every run because sibling refs and non-release branches can still drift.
- id: ecosystem-proof-029-b
  parent: ecosystem-proof-029
  lesson: ProtoKits ref drift closed, but latest-ref proof is still red.
  evidence: ProtoKits local `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolve to `3d42b725dd166274ff6c5452beef86ef17863852`, ahead/behind `0 0`, package metadata `@luminarylabs/nexusrealtime-protokits@0.0.2`; `npm run check` checked 370 modules then failed 110 import smokes rooted in missing package `nexusrealtime`.
  look further: Treat ProtoKits as latest-ref aligned but unvalidated until `nexusrealtime` resolves under the intended release-consumption model.
- id: ecosystem-proof-029-c
  parent: ecosystem-proof-029
  lesson: ProtoKits targeted DSK proof still never reaches first-wave assertions.
  evidence: Local/latest-ref `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` and disposable fetched-ref targeted smoke both failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
  look further: Re-run targeted DSK proof only after package/workspace/CDN/link resolution is defined.
- id: ecosystem-proof-029-d
  parent: ecosystem-proof-029
  lesson: Experiments fetched aggregate proof still passes while targeted DSK proof remains blocked by sibling-relative imports.
  evidence: Experiments local `HEAD` is `57b3d668891794ddad00c765ce4faf342a3d9000`; fetched `origin/0.0.2` is `3e047f693f3ed58cab1c362deb09a597398d05e5`; ahead/behind is `0 2`; disposable fetched aggregate `npm run check` passed, but targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed on missing `/private/tmp/.../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  look further: Re-run targeted DSK proof with the same module-source strategy intended for public proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-029-e
  parent: ecosystem-proof-029
  lesson: Public DSK proof remains HTTP-visible but not browser-complete.
  evidence: Fetch returned 200 for the proof route; Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and `Booting...`; console output showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.
  look further: Do not treat HTTP 200 on the route as browser proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-029-f
  parent: ecosystem-proof-029
  lesson: Experiments aggregate validation remains separate from targeted DSK proof.
  evidence: Disposable fetched Experiments `npm run check` passed and reported flat route smoke for 100 generated AAA registry routes, but `package.json` aggregate script does not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
  look further: Decide whether the DSK smoke belongs in `npm run check`, `npm run check:deploy`, or required targeted evidence.
- id: ecosystem-proof-029-g
  parent: ecosystem-proof-029
  lesson: Query read-model isolation is real neighboring hardening inventory but does not change distribution proof status.
  evidence: DSK architecture node `2026-06-20T05-24-33-0400`, deep bug node `2026-06-20T04-54-16-0400`, and domain idea node `2026-06-20T05-02-13-0400` add public query helper, engine read-method, nested metadata/hazard, and stored query snapshot isolation rows separate from module-source proof.
  look further: Route query read-model fixtures separately from module-source/public browser proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-029-h
  parent: ecosystem-proof-029
  lesson: Core/ProtoKits/Experiments ownership boundaries still hold.
  evidence: Repo memory and boundary docs keep core as runtime/DSK/composer owner, ProtoKits as reusable implementation owner, and Experiments as playable/browser proof owner; this run found no reason to move proof routing or reusable implementation into NexusRealtime core.
  look further: Fix proof routing/imports without moving route ownership, reusable implementation, or proof-readiness checklist tooling into NexusRealtime core.
