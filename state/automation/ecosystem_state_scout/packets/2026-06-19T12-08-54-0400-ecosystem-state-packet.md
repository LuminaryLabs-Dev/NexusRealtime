# Ecosystem State Packet: 2026-06-19T12-08-54-0400

## Scope
- Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem State Packet
- Local timestamp: 2026-06-19T12-08-54-0400
- UTC timestamp: 2026-06-19T16:08:54Z
- Workspace: `/Users/crimsonwheeler/Documents/GitHub/NexusRealtime`
- Repos checked: core NexusRealtime, sibling NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, sibling NexusRealtime-Experiments

## Lane Goal
- Audit NexusRealtime ecosystem state, drift, and proof readiness across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, DSK promotion ledgers, branch targets, public links, and proof paths.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `ecosystem-root-013`.
- Latest ecosystem state packet `2026-06-19T11-08-56-0400` said core and ProtoKits were latest-ref aligned and validation-green while Experiments was 24 commits behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`; public proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm/package policy, and DSK hardening gates were still open.
- Previous ecosystem state packet `2026-06-19T10-10-19-0400` kept the same proof-boundary split but had Experiments 22 commits behind origin.
- Latest DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T11-23-07-0400` says repeated scout evidence now points to executable hardening fixtures for namespace, install, dependency, source-state, and state-signal contracts.
- Latest ecosystem proof node `2026-06-19T11-40-11-0400` reopens ProtoKits latest-ref proof because fetched `origin/0.0.2` advanced 5 commits ahead of the local checkout; Experiments latest-ref proof and public browser proof remain open.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-19T11-55-07-0400` adds command lifecycle, elapsed-rate, spatial descriptor source-state, and generated-geometry bounds gaps.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-19T12-01-34-0400` converts those gaps into service lifecycle/config proof rows.
- These packets and nodes were context only. Live checkout state, fetched refs, docs, tests, preflight, public URLs, and Playwright launch-state output are authority for this run.

## Agent Workspace State
- Read `.agent/start-here.md`, `.agent/operating-model.md`, `.agent/automation-rules.md`, `.agent/report-format.md`, `.agent/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, `.agent/CHANGE_LOG.md`, and `memory.md`.
- Used `agent-it` mentality and the repo-local automation contract.
- Used Human View Orchestration and Playwright for the public proof launch-state check.
- Repo `memory.md` still defines core as ECS/runtime/DSK/composer primitives, ProtoKits as reusable implementation, and Experiments as browser/playable proof.
- No source, tests, public docs, package metadata, `.agent`, deployment, or canonical repo memory files were edited by this lane.
- Playwright CLI transient `.playwright-cli` artifacts were removed after inspection so this lane leaves only the packet, node, and tracker update.

## Latest Branch Preflight
- Command: `npm run automation:preflight`
- Result: pass
- Preflight timestamp: `2026-06-19T16:06:54.229Z`
- Latest remote release branch: `0.0.2`
- Compare target: `0.0.2`
- Current branch: `0.0.2`
- Branch status: `current-is-latest-release-branch`
- Remote branches observed by preflight: `0.0.1`, `0.0.2`, `main`
- Core `HEAD`: `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`
- Core `origin/0.0.2`: `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`
- Core ahead/behind against `origin/0.0.2`: `0 0`
- Core package metadata remains `nexusrealtime@0.1.0`; raw public branch `0.0.2/package.json` also reports version `0.1.0`.
- Core worktree still has pre-existing modified/untracked neighboring automation and planning docs. This lane writes only this ecosystem-state packet/node and tracker update.

## Ecosystem Findings
- Core remains aligned with the latest remote release branch `0.0.2`; `HEAD` equals `origin/0.0.2`.
- Core validation passed: `npm test` passed all 8 smoke tests.
- Required public core links remain reachable through GitHub, raw GitHub, and jsDelivr.
- Optional npm registry metadata remains unavailable with HTTP 404, so npm-backed public consumption is still not proven.
- ProtoKits local available checkout is clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2` by 5 commits: local `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`, origin `06f5f3bd35e3b4c2c24d49d4affbe026b0d92c8f`.
- ProtoKits available-checkout validation passed:
  - `npm run check`
  - `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs`
- ProtoKits fetched `origin/0.0.2` aggregate `test` script adds `node tests/universal-game-domain-kits.test.mjs`; this latest-ref aggregate was not run in the local checkout.
- ProtoKits first-wave DSK ledger still lists seven `promoted-candidate` kits and intentionally defers core promotion.
- Experiments local available checkout is clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2` by 24 commits: local `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f`, origin `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb`.
- Experiments targeted DSK validation passed on the available checkout: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- Experiments aggregate `npm run check` was not run because local and fetched scripts start with `npm run generate:flat-routes`; prior packets show this command writes generated route artifacts in the main checkout.
- Local and fetched Experiments aggregate scripts still omit `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- Fetched Experiments `origin/0.0.2` aggregate script includes `tests/tropical-island-scene-static-smoke.mjs`, while the local checkout still includes `tests/fluid-water-lab-static-smoke.mjs`.
- Public DSK proof route is still HTTP-visible but not browser-ready: Playwright snapshot showed heading text plus `Booting...`, and network requests showed 404s for missing sibling GitHub Pages module paths.
- Local and fetched proof files still import sibling relative paths: `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, and `../../../../NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/...`.
- Branch/version policy risk remains unchanged: release branch `0.0.2` serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.

## Domain And Kit Expansion Signals
- Current DSK core still exports `defineDomainServiceKit()`, `createDomainServiceToken()`, validation helpers, `createRealtimeGame()`, and runtime-kit primitives from `src/index.js`.
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md` and `docs/how-to-experiment.md` keep the ecosystem boundary explicit: core owns runtime/DSK/composer primitives, ProtoKits owns reusable implementation, and Experiments owns playable/browser proof.
- Neighboring DSK architecture now frames the next high-value work as non-scout executable hardening fixtures, not more broad scout confirmation.
- Neighboring deep bug and idea lanes add service lifecycle/config proof rows: command lifecycle, elapsed-rate semantics, descriptor normalization/source isolation, and finite generated geometry.
- Proof coverage should remain separated by category: local available-checkout command, latest release-ref command, aggregate command, targeted command, raw-public file, CDN import, npm availability, and browser-complete human proof.

## Evidence
- `npm run automation:preflight` passed and resolved latest branch `0.0.2`.
- Core `git status --short --branch` showed `## 0.0.2...origin/0.0.2` plus pre-existing automation/doc dirt.
- Core `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2` showed `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0` for both.
- Core `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2` showed `0 0`.
- Core `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
- ProtoKits `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`, and ahead/behind checks showed a clean local checkout behind origin by 5 commits.
- ProtoKits `npm run check` passed after checking 294 JavaScript modules, importing 236 ProtoKit indexes, and running its local smoke chain.
- ProtoKits `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed.
- ProtoKits fetched `package.json` adds `tests/universal-game-domain-kits.test.mjs` to the aggregate `test` script; commits ahead include universal game domain catalog/test/export work and an extend kit rules audit doc.
- Experiments `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`, and ahead/behind checks showed a clean local checkout behind origin by 24 commits.
- Experiments `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed on the available checkout.
- Direct curl checks confirmed required proof raw files and ProtoKits ledger are public, while runtime dependency paths used by the public page are 404.
- Playwright opened the public DSK proof route; snapshot showed `Booting...`; network output showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.

## Suggested Canonical Updates
- Validate ProtoKits fetched `origin/0.0.2` in a disposable worktree or clean fast-forwarded checkout before claiming latest-ref ProtoKits proof.
- Validate Experiments fetched `origin/0.0.2` in a disposable worktree or clean fast-forwarded checkout before claiming latest-ref Experiments proof.
- Keep public proof route work focused on module-source resolution: CDN `0.0.2`, deployed same-origin assets, or a build-step import map.
- Wire `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` into an aggregate Experiments validation command or document it as required targeted evidence.
- Make Experiments route generation idempotent, move it out of default aggregate checks, or standardize disposable validation for scout lanes.
- Update public consumption wording or release policy so docs distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch consumption from unavailable npm registry metadata.
- Decide whether branch `0.0.2` serving package version `0.1.0` is intentional policy or stale release metadata.
- Move repeated DSK hardening evidence into executable fixture work covering namespace/install/dependency, source-state, state-signal, and service lifecycle/config rows.

## Knowledge Nodes
- Wrote `state/automation/ecosystem_state_scout/knowledge_nodes/2026-06-19T12-08-54-0400-ecosystem-state-node.md`.
- New root lesson: Core remains latest-ref aligned and validation-green, but both sibling latest refs are ahead of local clean checkouts; available-checkout DSK proof passes locally while ProtoKits latest-ref proof, Experiments latest-ref proof, browser-complete public proof, aggregate Experiments DSK coverage, npm/package policy, and DSK hardening fixtures remain open.

## Master Tracker Updates
- Added `ecosystem-root-014`.
- Marked `ecosystem-root-013` as superseded by `ecosystem-root-014`.
- Added child branches for core alignment, ProtoKits latest-ref drift, Experiments latest-ref drift, public proof import shape, aggregate DSK proof validation, generated-route validation boundary, public npm gap, package-version policy, DSK hardening fixtures, and service lifecycle/config hardening.
