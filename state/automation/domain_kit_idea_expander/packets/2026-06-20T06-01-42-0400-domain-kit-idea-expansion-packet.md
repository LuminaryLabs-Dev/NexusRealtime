# Domain And Kit Idea Expansion Packet: 2026-06-20T06-01-42-0400

## Timestamp
- local: 2026-06-20T06-01-42-0400
- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-20-0502`.
- Latest current-lane packet converted public query helper outputs, engine read-method snapshots, nested metadata isolation, and stored query snapshots into Query Read Model Isolation.
- Latest ecosystem state packet `2026-06-20T05-11-41-0400` kept module-source strategy as the active ecosystem blocker and treated query read-model hardening as separate runtime inventory.
- Latest DSK architecture packet `2026-06-20T05-24-33-0400` kept runtime failure-boundary first and query read-model isolation as later hardening inventory.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet `2026-06-20T05-39-53-0400` kept ProtoKits, Experiments, public browser, npm, package-version, and aggregate-vs-targeted proof blockers separate from runtime hardening.
- Latest deep bug packet `2026-06-20T05-53-01-0400` adds a fresh family: active scheduler phase/system mutation during `run()`, same-run phase topology mutation, stale removed-entity `runSystem()` iteration, and live `world.readEvents()` payload mutation.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, lane prompt, preflight, tracker state, duplicate scan, and boundary docs were treated as authority for this run.

## Ideas added
- Added Scheduler World Mutation Isolation Domain to `docs/domain_ideas.md`.
- Added `scheduler-active-run-policy-kit`, `scheduler-phase-topology-kit`, `runsystem-membership-snapshot-kit`, `event-queue-payload-isolation-kit`, and `scheduler-world-mutation-proof-kit` to `docs/kits_ideas.md`.
- Added Scheduler World Mutation Isolation Harness to `docs/described_examples.md`.

## Ideas deferred
- A duplicate Runtime Failure Boundary Domain was deferred because this run narrows scheduler/world topology and event-read mutation policy rather than namespace, rollback, dependency parity, or failed-tick lifetime broadly.
- A duplicate Query Read Model Isolation Domain was deferred because `world.readEvents()` is a low-level event queue read, not a public service query helper or engine read-method contract.
- A duplicate Surface Snapshot Isolation row was deferred because this evidence occurs before surface publication at the ECS event queue boundary.
- Public module-source, npm metadata, and browser proof work were deferred because those remain ecosystem/proof lane blockers.
- Implementation work, source fixes, and test fixtures were deferred because this lane is planning inventory only.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate `scheduler-failure-lifetime-kit`; the new scheduler rows target active-run topology mutation and same-run phase/system addition, not failed-tick event replay.
- Did not duplicate `accepted-mutation-kit`; the new `runsystem-membership-snapshot-kit` narrows entity/component membership during one `runSystem()` iteration.
- Did not duplicate `event-handoff-kit`; the new event queue row targets payload alias isolation for low-level `readEvents()` calls before consumers and diagnostics read the queue.
- Did not duplicate `query-read-model-isolation-proof-kit`; the new proof row sits below query helper and service read contracts.

## DSK boundary notes
- The added rows are NexusRealtime core validation-surface inventory because the evidence targets ECS scheduler, world iteration, and event queue primitives.
- New reusable gameplay/domain implementations remain out of NexusRealtime core and should target NexusRealtime-ProtoKits by default.
- DSK promotion fixtures should treat scheduler/world mutation isolation as a lower-level runtime hardening tranche that supports but does not replace query read-model, runtime identity, content-boundary, and module-source proof rows.

## Open questions
- Should scheduler system and phase additions during an active run reject, queue to the next pass, or execute immediately by documented design?
- Should `world.runSystem()` recheck entity/component membership before each handler call or snapshot component values at query time?
- Should `world.readEvents()` clone/freeze payloads on emit, on read, or only through a separate proof/surface API?
- Should lifecycle surfaces record topology mutations made during a tick if those mutations do not execute until the next tick?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, or `.agent` files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route, fetched-ref proof, module-source strategy, or npm metadata was fixed.
- No ProtoKits or Experiments files were edited.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
