# Ecosystem State Packet: 2026-06-19T08-13-48-0400

## Scope
- Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem State Packet
- Local timestamp: 2026-06-19T08-13-48-0400
- UTC timestamp: 2026-06-19T12:13:48Z
- Workspace: `/Users/crimsonwheeler/Documents/GitHub/NexusRealtime`
- Repos checked: core NexusRealtime, sibling NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, sibling NexusRealtime-Experiments

## Lane Goal
- Audit NexusRealtime ecosystem state, drift, and proof readiness across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, DSK promotion ledgers, branch targets, public links, and proof paths.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `ecosystem-root-009`.
- Latest ecosystem state packet `2026-06-19T07-11-00-0400` said core, ProtoKits, and Experiments were clean/aligned on latest release refs and validation-green, while public browser proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy, and DSK hardening gates remained open.
- Latest DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T07-24-53-0400` adds receipt identity, event idempotency, claim policy, and request identity to the hardening fixture gates.
- Latest ecosystem proof node `2026-06-19T07-42-18-0400` keeps local latest-ref proof green but public browser proof blocked at `Booting...`.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-19T07-53-41-0400` adds AR/objective bridge phase, missing step receipts, and wrapper-owned state gaps.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-19T08-00-55-0400` converts those gaps into bridge phase, step transition receipt, delegated-action reconciliation, wrapper state contract, and bridge-state proof inventory.
- These packets and nodes were used for context only. Live checkout state, fetched refs, docs, tests, preflight, public URLs, and Playwright output are authority for this run.

## Agent Workspace State
- Read `.agent/start-here.md`, `.agent/operating-model.md`, `.agent/automation-rules.md`, `.agent/report-format.md`, `.agent/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, `.agent/CHANGE_LOG.md`, and `memory.md`.
- `.agent` guidance still requires live checkout evidence, latest release branch resolution, preflight, and lane-local scout outputs.
- Repo `memory.md` still defines NexusRealtime core as ECS/runtime/DSK/composer primitives, ProtoKits as reusable implementation, and Experiments as browser/playable proof.
- Human-view validation question answered: yes, public proof has a visible launch state. Playwright inspected the route, captured a snapshot/screenshot, and found the page still visible-stuck at `Booting...`.
- Playwright scratch artifacts were removed after evidence capture.
- No source, tests, public docs, package metadata, `.agent`, deployment, or canonical repo memory files were edited by this lane.

## Latest Branch Preflight
- Command: `npm run automation:preflight`
- Result: pass
- Preflight timestamp: `2026-06-19T12:07:33.686Z`
- Latest remote release branch: `0.0.2`
- Compare target: `0.0.2`
- Current branch: `0.0.2`
- Branch status: `current-is-latest-release-branch`
- Remote branches observed by preflight: `0.0.1`, `0.0.2`, `main`
- Core `HEAD`: `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`
- Core `origin/0.0.2`: `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`
- Core ahead/behind against `origin/0.0.2`: `0 0`
- Core package metadata remains `nexusrealtime@0.1.0`.
- Core worktree still has pre-existing modified/untracked neighboring automation and planning docs. This lane writes only this ecosystem-state packet/node and tracker update.

## Ecosystem Findings
- Core remains aligned with the latest remote release branch `0.0.2`; `HEAD` equals `origin/0.0.2` at `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`.
- Core validation passed: `npm test` passed all 8 smoke tests.
- Required public core links remain reachable through GitHub, raw GitHub, and jsDelivr.
- Optional npm registry metadata remains unavailable with HTTP 404, so npm-backed public consumption is still not proven.
- ProtoKits is clean and aligned with fetched `origin/0.0.2`: local and origin both resolve to `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`; ahead/behind `0 0`.
- ProtoKits validation passed:
  - `npm run check`
  - `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs`
- Experiments local checkout is clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`: local `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f`, origin `6a4982ec59a06b5e0c7c12a56da58eed15866b0f`, ahead/behind `0 22`.
- Experiments available-checkout validation passed:
  - `npm run check`
  - `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`
- Experiments `npm run check` generated 100 flat route wrappers and reformatted one tracked wrapper; those validation-generated sibling artifacts were removed/restored, and Experiments status returned clean.
- Fetched Experiments `origin/0.0.2` changes replace the local `fluid-water-lab` proof row with `tropical-island-scene`, add several tropical/island/prototype kits, and still do not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` in aggregate `check`.
- Experiments aggregate `npm run check` on the available checkout still does not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`; targeted DSK proof remains separate evidence.
- Public DSK proof route remains HTTP-visible but not browser-ready: Playwright snapshot showed heading text plus `Booting...`; console errors showed 404s for missing GitHub Pages module paths.
- Fetched Experiments proof file still imports sibling `NexusRealtime` and `NexusRealtime-ProtoKits` relative paths that map to missing GitHub Pages routes.
- ProtoKits ledger still lists seven first-wave `promoted-candidate` kits and intentionally defers core promotion.
- Branch/version policy risk remains unchanged: release branch `0.0.2` serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.

## Domain And Kit Expansion Signals
- Current DSK core still exports `defineDomainServiceKit()`, `createDomainServiceToken()`, validation helpers, `createRealtimeGame()`, and runtime-kit primitives from `src/index.js`.
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md` and `docs/how-to-experiment.md` keep the ecosystem boundary explicit: core owns runtime/DSK/composer primitives, ProtoKits owns reusable implementation, and Experiments owns playable/browser proof.
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`, `docs/kits_ideas.md`, and `docs/described_examples.md` now include bridge/state ownership inventory in addition to spatial/mobility and receipt integrity planning inventory.
- Neighboring lanes now separate four classes of readiness:
  - distribution/proof readiness: public proof module loading, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy.
  - sibling readiness: core and ProtoKits are aligned; Experiments local proof is green but latest fetched ref is ahead again.
  - DSK hardening readiness: namespace safety, install transactions, dependency policy, state contracts, service-call policy, operations data integrity, spatial/mobility invariants, receipt/event identity.
  - bridge/state readiness: phase-safe event delivery, step receipts, delegated-action reconciliation, wrapper state contracts, and bridge-state proof rows.
- Proof coverage should remain separated by category: local command, latest release-ref command, aggregate command, targeted command, raw-public file, CDN import, npm availability, and browser-complete human proof.

## Evidence
- `npm run automation:preflight` passed and resolved latest branch `0.0.2`.
- Core `git status --short --branch` showed `## 0.0.2...origin/0.0.2` plus pre-existing automation/doc dirt.
- Core `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2` and `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2` showed `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0` with ahead/behind `0 0`.
- Core `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
- ProtoKits `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`, and ahead/behind checks showed clean alignment at `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`.
- ProtoKits `npm run check` passed after checking 294 JavaScript modules, importing 236 ProtoKit indexes, and running the test chain including fluid/water kit composition.
- ProtoKits `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed.
- Experiments `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`, and ahead/behind checks showed clean local checkout behind fetched release ref by 22 commits.
- Experiments `npm run check` passed with existing static smoke warnings and generated 100 flat route wrappers during validation.
- Experiments `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed.
- Experiments generated validation artifacts were removed/restored; final sibling status was clean and still behind `origin/0.0.2` by 22.
- Direct curl checks confirmed required proof raw files and ProtoKits ledger are public, while runtime dependency paths used by the public page are 404.
- Playwright opened the public DSK proof route; snapshot showed `Booting...`; console log showed 404s for deployed sibling module paths plus favicon; screenshot confirmed the user-visible stuck proof page. Scratch `.playwright-cli/` artifacts were removed after inspection.

## Suggested Canonical Updates
- Reopen sibling latest-ref validation for Experiments: local proof is green, but fetched `origin/0.0.2` has 22 commits not locally validated.
- Keep public proof route work focused on module-source resolution: CDN `0.0.2`, deployed same-origin assets, or a build-step import map.
- Wire `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` into an aggregate Experiments validation command or document it as required targeted evidence.
- Update public consumption wording or release policy so docs distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch consumption from unavailable npm registry metadata.
- Decide whether branch `0.0.2` serving package version `0.1.0` is intentional policy or stale release metadata.
- Keep DSK expansion claims advisory until hardening fixtures include install/namespace, spatial/mobility, operations data, receipt identity, event idempotency, bridge phase, step receipts, and wrapper state ownership rows.
- Consider making Experiments flat-route generation idempotent or pairing it with a cleanup command, because aggregate validation dirties the sibling checkout.

## Knowledge Nodes
- Wrote `state/automation/ecosystem_state_scout/knowledge_nodes/2026-06-19T08-13-48-0400-ecosystem-state-node.md`.
- New root lesson: core and ProtoKits remain release-aligned and validation-green, but Experiments latest fetched ref has advanced beyond the clean local checkout while public browser proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy, generated-route cleanliness, and DSK hardening/bridge-state gates remain open.

## Master Tracker Updates
- Added `ecosystem-root-010`.
- Marked `ecosystem-root-009` as superseded by `ecosystem-root-010`.
- Added child branches for renewed Experiments sibling latest-ref drift, public proof import shape, aggregate DSK proof validation, generated flat-route cleanliness, bridge/state hardening, public npm gap, package-version policy, and DSK hardening proof gates.
- Reopened sibling latest-ref validation for Experiments while preserving ProtoKits alignment as green for this run.
