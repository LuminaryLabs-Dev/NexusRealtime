# Ecosystem Proof State Packet

Timestamp: 2026-06-19T06:46:32-0400
Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem Proof State Packet
Scope: NexusRealtime core, NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, NexusRealtime-Experiments
Result: partial; core is release-aligned and available-checkout validation passes across all three repos, but sibling local checkouts remain behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`, the public DSK browser proof still stalls at `Booting...`, and aggregate DSK proof coverage remains incomplete.

## Lane Goal
- Audit proof coverage across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, public routes, and DSK expansion ideas.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `ecosystem-proof-007`.
- Latest proof packet `2026-06-19T05-42-20-0400` said core was release-aligned and available-checkout DSK smokes passed, but fetched ProtoKits and Experiments `origin/0.0.2` were ahead of local checkouts and the public proof route still stalled at `Booting...`.
- Latest ecosystem state packet `2026-06-19T06-09-33-0400` confirmed the clean-yet-behind sibling state, public proof import failure, aggregate DSK smoke omission, npm metadata gap, package-version policy risk, and broader DSK hardening gates.
- Latest DSK architecture packet `2026-06-19T06-24-24-0400` added spatial/mobility invariant gates to the DSK promotion fixture plan.
- Latest deep bug packet `2026-06-19T05-53-25-0400` reported spatial transition, zero-time scenario, hazard identity, and zero-capacity boost bugs.
- Latest domain idea packet `2026-06-19T06-00-34-0400` mapped those bugs into spatial/mobility invariant planning inventory.
- These packets were used for context only. Live source, fetched refs, package scripts, tests, preflight, public URLs, and Playwright output are authority for this run.

## Latest branch
- `npm run automation:preflight` resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`.
- NexusRealtime local branch `0.0.2` at `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`, matching `origin/0.0.2`; ahead/behind `0/0`.
- ProtoKits local branch `0.0.2` at `8c1c933e5dc21cab0579dc3ae806341413f18b00`; fetched `origin/0.0.2` is `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8`; local is behind by 22 commits.
- Experiments local branch `0.0.2` at `b4d48101ec599ae9ca2998734040874f377c8108`; fetched `origin/0.0.2` is `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f`; local is behind by 33 commits.
- Core package metadata remains `nexusrealtime@0.1.0` locally and on raw public branch `0.0.2`.
- Worktree note: NexusRealtime had pre-existing modified/untracked automation/doc state before this run. ProtoKits and Experiments status output showed only behind status, not local modified/untracked files. No pull, reset, rebase, merge, deployment, or source edit was performed from this lane.

- NexusRealtime/ProtoKits/Experiments: `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD`, `git rev-parse origin/0.0.2`, `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2`.
- NexusRealtime: `npm test` -> passed 8 smoke tests.
- ProtoKits available checkout: `npm run check` -> passed syntax check, import smoke, and listed test chain; targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` -> passed.
- Experiments available checkout: `npm run check` -> passed the local listed smoke chain with existing static smoke warnings; targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` -> passed.
- Fetched ref inspection: `git show origin/0.0.2:...` for Experiments DSK proof files/package script and ProtoKits DSK ledger/domain-service-kits.
- Public URL checks: direct `curl -L -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"`.
- Human-view browser check: Playwright opened the public DSK proof route, captured snapshot and screenshot under `.playwright-cli`, and console logs; scratch artifacts were removed after inspection.
- Targeted `rg` scans checked DSK aliases, `engine.n.*`, import maps, stale public pins, proof routes, package scripts, idea docs, and proof coverage.

## ProtoKits migration state
- Public raw `0.0.2` still includes `docs/DSK-FIRST-WAVE-LEDGER.md`.
- The ledger still lists seven first-wave `promoted-candidate` kits: token registry, completion ledger, scan survey, route checkpoint, resource pressure, zone field, and hazard director.
- Available-checkout targeted DSK test passed and still proves direct `createN...Kit()` use, legacy compatibility calls, `engine.n.*` install, compatibility `engine.*` APIs, serializable snapshots, and missing-token failure.
- Fetched `origin/0.0.2` adds broader ProtoKits surface area including 2d platformer, adventure, environment, survival crafting, fluid, and water surfaces. It still keeps `createNCompletionLedgerKit`.
- The available local ProtoKits checkout is behind `origin/0.0.2`, so this run does not claim latest remote ProtoKits aggregate validation. It only proves the available checkout plus public raw file presence.
- Compatibility shim exit remains unresolved; direct-import, injected-runtime, `engine.n.*`, and legacy `engine.*` API paths all remain active.

## Experiment proof state
- Public raw `0.0.2` still includes `experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/index.html` and `src/proof.js`.
- Fetched `origin/0.0.2` `index.html` still maps bare `nexusrealtime` to `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
- Fetched `origin/0.0.2` `src/proof.js` still imports `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, `../../../../NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`, and `../../../../NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`.
- Targeted local smoke `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed.
- Available-checkout `npm run check` passed, but it was run against the local behind checkout.
- Available-checkout `npm run check` and fetched `origin/0.0.2` `check` both still omit `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- Public route human-view result: a reviewer sees the heading, description, and `Booting...`; the proof never reaches JSON output.
- Playwright console evidence shows 404s for:
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`

## Domain and kit proof coverage
- Current public proof route still only attempts first-wave DSK service APIs: `zoneField`, `scanSurvey`, `routeCheckpoint`, `resourcePressure`, `hazardDirector`, and `completionLedger`.
- `tokenRegistry` remains covered by ProtoKits targeted DSK tests but not by the public Experiments proof output.
- Idea docs and described examples now cover broader domains: proof surfaces, coverage matrices, operations data integrity, spatial/mobility invariants, transition-state policy, immediate-threshold policy, hazard identity, resource-bound normalization, water/fluid domains, and experiment boundaries.
- Fetched ProtoKits `origin/0.0.2` adds expanded fluid/water and domain-service-kit surface area, but no browser-complete proof route was found for those broader domains.
- Coverage classification remains a scout map from file/token inspection, not a final architecture audit.

## Runtime ownership drift
- No new DSK proof renderer-vs-runtime drift was found; the first-wave proof route is runtime/API-only and visible rendering is page text.
- Core owns generic DSK runtime contracts; ProtoKits owns first-wave and newer reusable kit implementations/adapters; Experiments owns browser proof routes and smoke commands.
- New reusable proof work should still target ProtoKits for reusable domains and Experiments for browser/playable proof, not core, unless it exposes a missing runtime primitive or invariant.
- DSK production blockers remain broader than public proof import loading: namespace safety, install atomicity, dependency policy, state contracts, accepted mutation, completion idempotency, time catch-up, config normalization, immutable config, generated id policy, finite ledgers, restored-state consistency, spatial transition state, immediate thresholds, hazard identity, and resource-bound normalization.

## Broken/stale proof paths
- Public DSK proof route remains HTTP-visible but runtime-broken because browser imports resolve to missing sibling GitHub Pages paths.
- Optional npm package metadata still returns 404, so npm consumption remains unproved.
- Experiments still contains stale or non-latest CDN pins including `@0.0.1` and `@main` across next-ledge, signal-bastion, high-fidelity meadow, path-meadow, zombie-orchard, fogline, and open-above surfaces.
- ProtoKits README/apps still contain `@main` NexusRealtime/ProtoKits consumption examples.
- Available-checkout and fetched Experiments aggregate `check` still omit the DSK first-wave smoke even though the targeted smoke exists and passes locally.
- Local sibling checkouts are behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`, so available local check pass and latest remote release-ref state are separate claims.
- Release branch `0.0.2` continues to serve package metadata version `0.1.0`.

## Risks
- A reviewer can mistake route HTTP 200 and raw file availability for a working public browser proof.
- A reviewer can mistake available local sibling validation for latest release-ref validation because both sibling checkouts are behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`.
- Local tests import sibling workspace files and do not exercise GitHub Pages module resolution.
- Aggregate Experiments validation can pass without running the DSK first-wave smoke.
- Compatibility shims keep multiple API paths alive without a recorded removal condition.
- Expansion idea docs and newer ProtoKits surfaces are broader than executable proof coverage.
- DSK hardening blockers can be hidden by green first-wave API proof unless promotion review separates distribution proof from runtime invariant proof.

## Blockers
- Fast-forward or separately validate the local ProtoKits and Experiments checkouts against fetched `origin/0.0.2` before claiming latest sibling release-ref validation.
- The public DSK proof route must load NexusRealtime and ProtoKits from public-safe URLs, same-origin deployed assets, or a build-step import map before a public browser proof can be claimed.
- DSK first-wave smoke should be included in an aggregate Experiments validation path or explicitly documented as a required targeted proof command before reviewers rely on `npm run check` for DSK coverage.
- Scout lane rules did not allow source fixes, publishing, package metadata edits, public claim edits, new tests, or pulling/merging sibling branches.

## Suggested next review item
- First fast-forward or separately validate sibling checkouts against fetched `origin/0.0.2`; then fix the public proof module-source strategy for `experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/index.html` and `src/proof.js`; then wire or document `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` as required aggregate evidence.

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, docs, package metadata, memory, release branches, public claims, or proof routes were fixed.
- No deployment, push, pull, merge, rebase, release, npm publication, or package publication was performed.
- HTTP 200 for the public proof route is not claimed as a working browser proof.
- Available-checkout `npm run check` is not claimed as latest remote release-ref validation for ProtoKits or Experiments.
- Passing Experiments aggregate `npm run check` is not claimed to include DSK first-wave proof coverage.
