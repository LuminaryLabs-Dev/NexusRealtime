## Root Lesson
- id: dsk-bridge-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0823
- statement: DSK remains release-aligned and test-green, but promotion fixtures must now include bridge phase delivery, step-transition receipts, delegated-action reconciliation, and wrapper state contracts alongside namespace, install, dependency, state-contract, service-call, operations data, spatial/mobility, and receipt-integrity gates.
- why it matters: Fresh source and probe evidence shows composed services can accept or emit work while downstream consumers never see it, final completion can happen without step receipts, and wrapper APIs can report stale owned state after delegated mutation.

## Child Nodes

  parent: dsk-bridge-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0823
  lesson: Core still matches the latest release branch, so the new bridge-state conclusion is not caused by branch drift.
  evidence: `npm run automation:preflight` resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ahead/behind was `0 0`; `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
  look further: Keep resolving latest release branch every run and treat prior packet commit hashes as context only.
- id: dsk-install-hardening-unchanged-2026-06-19-0823
  parent: dsk-bridge-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0823
  lesson: Namespace, failed-install transaction, and direct dependency policy blockers remain unchanged on the live checkout.
  evidence: `src/domain-service-kit.js:143-161` still uses plain-object `engine.n` and late API assignment; `src/runtime-kit.js:135-157` still records DSK metadata and pushes kits before late install hooks; `src/runtime-kit.js:142-145` still filters missing direct DSK requirements to `n:` tokens; probe returned `protoOwn:false`, retained `n-late-collision-kit` after collision, and installed a kit requiring missing `runtime:needed`.
  look further: Add fixtures for reserved API names, install rollback, and direct-install dependency policy before new DSK promotion claims.
- id: dsk-bridge-phase-delivery-gap-2026-06-19-0823
  parent: dsk-bridge-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0823
  lesson: Bridge services need explicit same-tick, next-tick, or direct-service delivery policy before raw events can be treated as promoted DSK handoffs.
  evidence: `src/surface-placement-kit.js:8-20` emits `ObjectiveFlowAction` from a `resolve` system, while `src/objective-flow-kit.js:81-117` consumes actions in `simulate`; focused probe emitted `ARAnchorPlaced` and kept ObjectiveFlow at `completed:false`, `progress:0` after two ticks.
  look further: Decide whether SurfacePlacement should use direct ObjectiveFlow service calls, earlier-phase events, persistent next-tick events, or a reusable bridge-phase policy fixture.
- id: dsk-step-transition-receipt-gap-2026-06-19-0823
  parent: dsk-bridge-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0823
  lesson: Objective and AR lesson domains need step receipts for one-step, final-step, reset, and duplicate-attempt cases, not only mid-flow next-step transitions.
  evidence: `src/objective-flow-kit.js:90-105` and `src/ar-experience-kit.js:103-114` emit step completion only when the previous complete step differs from the current step; probe returned `objectiveStepBatches:0`, `objectiveCompletionBatches:1`, `arStepBatches:0`, `arCompletionBatches:1`.
  look further: Define a shared step-transition receipt shape before ObjectiveFlow, ARExperience, lesson, puzzle, or public proof rows rely on step telemetry.
- id: dsk-wrapper-state-contract-gap-2026-06-19-0823
  parent: dsk-bridge-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0823
  lesson: Puzzle/platformer wrappers need to own state, mirror delegated InteractionTarget state, or declare themselves stateless adapters.
  evidence: `src/symbol-alignment-kit.js:18-23`, `src/lock-and-socket-kit.js:19-28`, `src/reveal-light-kit.js:19-24`, `src/sorting-kit.js:18-23`, `src/moving-target-kit.js:18-23`, and `src/micro-platformer-kit.js:20-29` delegate actions to `engine.interactionTargets`; probe returned `targetComplete:true` while SymbolAlignment stayed `aligned:0`.
  look further: Add wrapper-state contract fixtures for owned paths, mirrored paths, reset/snapshot ownership, and explicit stateless adapter declarations.
- id: dsk-proof-boundary-still-separated-2026-06-19-0823
  parent: dsk-bridge-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0823
  lesson: Bridge-state and wrapper-state hardening remain separate from public browser proof and aggregate validation.
  evidence: Ecosystem state packet `2026-06-19T08-13-48-0400` keeps sibling latest-ref validation green while public proof remains `Booting...`, aggregate DSK smoke coverage is separate, npm metadata is unavailable, and DSK hardening gates remain open.
  look further: Keep runtime hardening fixtures, targeted proof, aggregate validation, and browser-complete public proof as separate evidence categories.
