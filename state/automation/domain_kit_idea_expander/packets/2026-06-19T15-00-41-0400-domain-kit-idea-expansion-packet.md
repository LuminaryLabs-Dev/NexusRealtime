# Domain And Kit Idea Expansion Packet: 2026-06-19T15-00-41-0400

## Timestamp
- local: 2026-06-19T15-00-41-0400
- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-19-1400`.
- Latest current-lane packet added Runtime Failure Boundary Domain, DSK namespace policy, DSK install rollback, DSK dependency parity, scheduler failure lifetime, and runtime failure-boundary proof rows.
- Latest ecosystem state packet says core remains aligned with latest release branch `0.0.2`, while module-source strategy still blocks ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof, and public browser proof.
- Latest DSK architecture packet keeps runtime failure-boundary rows in core hardening scope and separates those rows from public/distribution proof.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet keeps local available-checkout proof separate from fetched-ref, aggregate, targeted DSK, browser-complete, npm, and runtime hardening proof.
- Latest deep bug packet adds domain-kit edge evidence: repeated CharacterRagdoll `Staggered` receipts, no AR fallback after WebXR start failure, RealismKit custom quality object replacement, and FishingKit empty content placeholders.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, source snippets, preflight, and direct file inspection were treated as authority for this run.

## Ideas added
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`
  - Experience Edge Contract Domain for recovery receipt policy, launch fallback chains, quality profile contracts, content dataset contracts, and proof rows.
- `docs/kits_ideas.md`
  - `control-recovery-receipt-kit`
  - `launch-fallback-chain-kit`
  - `quality-profile-contract-kit`
  - `content-dataset-contract-kit`
  - `experience-edge-proof-kit`
- `docs/described_examples.md`
  - Experience Edge Contract Harness joining control receipts, launch fallback, presentation profile, content contract, and proof domains.

## Ideas deferred
- Direct fixes for CharacterRagdoll, AR launcher, RealismKit, and FishingKit were deferred because this lane cannot edit source or tests.
- A second Receipt Integrity Domain was not added because the new control issue is narrower: recovery-ready state repeatedly emits a specific one-shot receipt.
- A second State Signal Contract Domain was not added because the new evidence covers launch fallback, presentation profile handling, and content contracts in addition to action signals.
- A second Source State Integrity Domain was not added because empty dataset semantics need required-field and disabled-state policy, not only authored-source isolation.
- Public browser proof and module-source strategy were deferred because those belong to ecosystem/proof lanes.
- Executable edge fixtures were deferred because this lane is planning inventory only.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate `event-idempotency-kit`; `control-recovery-receipt-kit` narrows to recovery/stagger state and recover transition receipts.
- Did not duplicate `recovery-receipt-state-kit`; the new row focuses on character-control receipt suppression, while the existing traversal row covers final recovered-state consistency.
- Did not duplicate `bridge-phase-policy-kit`; `launch-fallback-chain-kit` focuses on start-time mode fallback after selected mode failure.
- Did not duplicate `config-normalization-kit`; `quality-profile-contract-kit` focuses on custom/named profile ownership and diagnostics.
- Did not duplicate `authored-source-isolation-kit`; `content-dataset-contract-kit` focuses on empty, missing, unknown, and duplicate dataset semantics.
- Did not duplicate `runtime-failure-boundary-proof-kit`; `experience-edge-proof-kit` is domain-kit edge coverage, not DSK install/scheduler hardening.

## DSK boundary notes
- `control-recovery-receipt-kit`, `content-dataset-contract-kit`, and `experience-edge-proof-kit` default to NexusRealtime-ProtoKits because they describe reusable domain-kit validation and policy rows.
- `launch-fallback-chain-kit` points at NexusRealtime core validation surfaces because AR launch fallback is an existing core runtime/launcher invariant.
- `quality-profile-contract-kit` points at NexusRealtime core validation surfaces because RealismKit/presentation profile resolution is existing core presentation behavior.
- Public module-source blockers remain separate from launch fallback behavior; a page can load and still fail AR fallback policy, or fail loading before AR fallback is exercised.
- Runtime failure-boundary rows remain separate from domain-kit edge contracts; DSK install safety does not validate repeated receipts, custom profile handling, or empty content datasets.

## Open questions
- Should `Staggered` be an edge-triggered receipt, a rate-limited diagnostic, or persistent recovery-ready state?
- Should AR launch always iterate preferred modes after recoverable start failure, or require an explicit fallback-enabled option?
- Should custom RealismKit quality objects be accepted directly, registered by id, or rejected with diagnostics?
- Should empty FishingKit species/lure arrays disable spawn/cast behavior, or should install fail fast on missing required content?
- Should the first executable edge fixture live in core tests, ProtoKits policy tests, or an Experiments proof harness?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, or `.agent` files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route or module-source strategy was fixed.
- No ProtoKits or Experiments fetched-ref validation was performed.
- No npm publication or deployment was performed.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
