# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem_state_scout 2026-06-19T20-10-14-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-root-022
- statement: Core remains current and validation-green, but ecosystem proof readiness is still blocked by one unresolved module-source strategy; the live delta is that ProtoKits fetched `origin/0.0.2` advanced to `f0fa45a` and is now 26 commits ahead of the local available checkout, while Experiments remains 24 commits behind and public browser proof still stalls at `Booting...`.
- why it matters: Promotion review cannot rely on local available-checkout green checks alone. ProtoKits fetched-ref validation, Experiments fetched-ref targeted validation, and public browser proof still need one declared module-source model before distribution proof can converge; new compatibility/content-safety rows are separate hardening inventory, not evidence that distribution proof is fixed.

## Child Nodes
- id: core-current-2026-06-19-2010
  parent: ecosystem-root-022
  lesson: Core still matches the preflight-resolved latest release branch and passes its smoke suite.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ahead/behind was `0 0`; `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
  look further: Continue resolving latest release branch with preflight each run because sibling refs keep moving.
- id: local-available-checkout-green-2026-06-19-2010
  parent: ecosystem-root-022
  lesson: Local available-checkout validation still passes across core, ProtoKits, and the targeted Experiments DSK proof.
  evidence: Core `npm test` passed; ProtoKits `npm run check` and `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed; Experiments `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed.
  look further: Keep local available-checkout proof separate from fetched-ref and public browser proof.
- id: protokits-fetched-ref-drift-2026-06-19-2010
  parent: ecosystem-root-022
  lesson: ProtoKits fetched latest release ref advanced again and now fails detached validation from `f0fa45a` because package `nexusrealtime` is not resolvable.
  evidence: Local ProtoKits `HEAD` was `40d70b9`; fetched `origin/0.0.2` was `f0fa45a75eea2c4b88683fe3bf146b0453812820`; ahead/behind after fetch was `0 26`; disposable fetched-ref `npm run check` failed during `smoke:imports` with 110 failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime` from `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js`.
  look further: Validate fetched ProtoKits with a declared package, workspace, CDN, or link model for NexusRealtime.
- id: experiments-targeted-fetched-ref-resolution-2026-06-19-2010
  parent: ecosystem-root-022
  lesson: Experiments fetched aggregate proof can pass while targeted DSK proof fails on sibling-relative imports.
  evidence: Disposable extracted Experiments `origin/0.0.2` at `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb` passed `npm run check` and generated 100 flat route wrappers; targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed because `src/proof.js` resolved `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js` to missing `/private/tmp/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  look further: Run targeted DSK proof with the same module-source strategy intended for public proof.
- id: public-proof-import-shape-2026-06-19-2010
  parent: ecosystem-root-022
  lesson: The public DSK proof route remains HTTP-visible but browser-stuck at `Booting...`.
  evidence: Direct fetch returned 200 for the proof route; Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof` and visible `Booting...`; console/request checks showed 404s for `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`, and `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or a build-step import map for the public proof route.
- id: module-source-strategy-2026-06-19-2010
  parent: ecosystem-root-022
  lesson: ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof, and public browser proof remain one module-source problem.
  evidence: ProtoKits failed on package-name `nexusrealtime`; Experiments targeted proof failed on missing sibling `NexusRealtime`; public route failed on deployed sibling module 404s.
  look further: Define one resolution model and use it in local, disposable, and public proof paths.
- id: compatibility-content-safety-inventory-2026-06-19-2010
  parent: ecosystem-root-022
  lesson: Legacy sequence replay/reset, legacy `AnyChild` cleanup, owning-kit lookup, and AR default text-safety are new hardening inventory, not distribution proof.
  evidence: Deep bug node `2026-06-19T19-54-18-0400` and domain idea node `2026-06-19T20-00-12-0400` add compatibility/content-safety rows; live proof evidence still shows package/sibling/browser module-resolution failures.
  look further: Decide whether these rows form a sixth hardening tranche or a separate legacy compatibility proof group after base distribution and runtime hardening decisions.
- id: public-consumption-npm-gap-2026-06-19-2010
  parent: ecosystem-root-022
  lesson: GitHub/raw/jsDelivr consumption remains reachable while npm package metadata still returns 404.
  evidence: `npm run automation:preflight` returned 200 for required GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links and 404 for `https://registry.npmjs.org/nexusrealtime`.
  look further: `README.md`, `package.json`, npm publication policy, and public consumption wording.
- id: package-version-policy-2026-06-19-2010
  parent: ecosystem-root-022
  lesson: Release branch `0.0.2` still serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.
  evidence: Local package metadata reports `nexusrealtime@0.1.0`; preflight confirmed raw public `0.0.2/package.json` is reachable.
  look further: Branch naming policy, package version policy, and README release wording.
