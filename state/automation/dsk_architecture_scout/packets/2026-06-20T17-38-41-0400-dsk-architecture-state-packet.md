# DSK Architecture State Packet: 2026-06-20T17-38-41-0400

## Timestamp

- automation: Nexus Realtime: DSK Architecture State Packet

## Lane Goal
- Audit DSK architecture, contracts, invariants, scaling, and promotion risk for long-term NexusRealtime production viability.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `dsk-scheduler-world-mutation-context-root-2026-06-20-0623`.
- Latest DSK packet kept runtime failure-boundary as tranche 1 and added scheduler/world mutation isolation: active-run scheduler mutation, phase topology mutation, `runSystem()` removed-entity membership, and `readEvents()` payload aliasing.
- Latest ecosystem state node `2026-06-20T06-09-43-0400` and ecosystem proof node `2026-06-20T06-40-01-0400` keep package/module-source strategy, public browser proof, npm metadata, package-version policy, aggregate-vs-targeted proof, and fetched-ref proof separate from DSK hardening.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-20T06:54:16-04:00` adds procedural/navigation state ownership: `requestPath()` caller-owned endpoint aliasing, navigation/procedural live snapshots, and `regenerate()` live return state.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-20T07-00-46-0400` maps that evidence into Procedural Navigation State Ownership planning inventory, not source authority and not a distribution proof fix.
- State packets were context only. Live source, docs, tests, git refs, preflight, and focused probes were treated as authority.

## DSK contract state
- `defineRuntimeKit()` remains the low-level installable kit primitive for components, resources, events, systems, registries, sequences, SequenceNode fields, bindings, metadata, and install hooks (`src/runtime-kit.js:35-59`).
- `defineDomainServiceKit()` still wraps RuntimeKit with `n:` tokens, stable `n-<domain>-kit` ids, required version/stability metadata, linear execution metadata, and `engine.n.<apiName>` installation (`src/domain-service-kit.js:123-195`).
- DSK metadata still declares async-ready, serializable state, snapshot, and reset expectations while current execution remains scheduler-linear (`src/domain-service-kit.js:131-139`; `README.md:136-140`).
- `engine.n` is still initialized as a normal object and assigned late through the wrapped install hook (`src/domain-service-kit.js:143-161`).
- `installRuntimeKit()` still records DSK metadata, kit bindings, and kit identity before `initWorld`, registry, scheduler, SequenceNode, and install hooks can throw (`src/runtime-kit.js:135-215`).
- Direct DSK installation still checks only missing `n:` requirements, while `createGameKitComposer()` resolves every required token before composition (`src/runtime-kit.js:142-145`; `src/game-kit-composer.js:49-76`).
- `createProceduralKit()` and `createPathfindingKit()` are core public procedural/navigation primitives exported from `src/index.js`; their command/read surfaces are DSK promotion-adjacent because generated-world, traversal, and proof adapters depend on deterministic request and snapshot ownership.

## Invariant coverage
- Covered by smoke tests: export presence, basic DSK validation, metadata shape, token creation, extension duplicate checks, missing `n:` rejection, normal API installation, serializable snapshot happy path, same-object reinstall idempotency, same-id duplicate rejection, normal API collision throw, and happy-path procedural/navigation resolution across grid/navmesh modes.
- Not covered: reserved API names, own-property namespace policy, failed-install rollback, direct non-`n:` dependency parity, duplicate provider/binding diagnostics, ECS definition-name collision policy, SequenceNode duplicate type policy, install-only kit idempotency, event-history isolation, disposed listener parity, scheduler failed-tick lifetime, active-run scheduler mutation, phase topology mutation, `runSystem()` membership, event payload isolation, reset/snapshot failure, async metadata truth, query read-model isolation, content-boundary/objective rows, and procedural/navigation command/snapshot ownership.
- Focused DSK probe evidence:
  - reserved API: `reservedOwn:false`, `reservedKeys:[]`, `inheritedMarker:"__proto__-api"`, `protoMarker:"__proto__-api"`.
  - failed clean API collision: first collision threw, second same-object reinstall returned `n-late-collision-probe-kit`, API owner stayed `base`, `initWorld` mutation remained, and `engine.kits`/`engine.domainServiceKits` retained the failed kit.
  - dependency parity: direct install with `requires:["runtime:missing"]` installed `n-needs-runtime-probe-kit`, while composer rejected the same graph as unresolved.
  - binding ownership: composer and engine both kept duplicate binding `service` from second kit `binding-b`.
- Focused procedural/navigation probe evidence:
  - `engine.navigation.requestPath()` returned and queued a request whose `start` and `goal` changed to `{ x:999, ... }` and `{ y:-999, ... }` after mutating the returned request and original caller-owned endpoint before tick.
  - The mutated queued path failed after tick because endpoint state changed after enqueue.
  - Mutating `engine.navigation.snapshot().paths` injected `{ id:"reader-injected" }` into later snapshot reads.
  - Mutating `engine.procedural.snapshot().cells[0]` and `.walkability.cells[0]` changed later snapshot reads to `walkable:true` and `material:"mutated-by-reader"`.
  - Mutating the object returned by `engine.procedural.regenerate()` changed pending generation state; the next procedural snapshot used `seed:"tampered-before-tick"`.

## Domain and kit expansion architecture notes
- Core/ProtoKits/Experiments ownership stayed stable: core owns runtime, ECS, scheduler, DSK contract, composer, stable primitives, and validation surfaces; ProtoKits owns new reusable domain implementations; Experiments owns playable/browser proof (`docs/how-to-protokit.md:7-15`, `docs/how-to-protokit.md:53-68`, `docs/how-to-protokit.md:99-105`).
- Procedural Navigation State Ownership is not a new gameplay implementation request. It is core validation-surface inventory for existing procedural/navigation command and proof APIs (`docs/domain_ideas.md:1226-1245`; `docs/kits_ideas.md:1181-1215`; `docs/described_examples.md:1088-1114`).
- This family sits after scheduler/world mutation in the hardening queue because scheduler/world determines lower-level tick/event isolation, while procedural/navigation ownership determines generated-world command and snapshot proof safety.
- Query read-model isolation remains a separate proof-trust tranche for logistics/spatial/hazard/water-style public read APIs.
- Public module-source strategy remains an ecosystem/proof decision. Fixing package/import paths would not prove request payload cloning, snapshot isolation, or regenerate return-state ownership.

## Scaling risks
- Broad DSK promotion still increases collision, inherited-key, and ownership risks while `engine.n` is a normal object.
- Partial installs can leave DSK metadata, kit identity, bindings, world mutations, registries, systems, sequence runtimes, or service APIs inconsistent after late throws.
- Direct install and composer dependency behavior can diverge for the same dependency-bearing DSK graph.
- Duplicate provider tokens and binding names can make large graphs appear satisfied while ownership is ambiguous or last-writer-wins.
- Navigation commands that retain caller objects can make replay, AI adapters, SequenceNode bridges, and editor tools mutate queued work after an explicit command boundary.
- Navigation and procedural snapshots that expose live resources can turn dashboards, renderers, public proof pages, and validation harnesses into accidental simulation writers.
- `regenerate()` returning live state lets a UI or proof tool cancel, redirect, or corrupt pending procedural generation through a value that looks like a summary.
- Local/fetched/public DSK proof can regress independently of core smoke tests when module-source policy is implicit.

## Bug candidates
- Confirmed: reserved `apiName:"__proto__"` installs through prototype behavior without an own `engine.n` slot.
- Confirmed: failed late API collision is non-atomic and same-object reinstall returns success without installing the promised API.
- Confirmed/design gap: direct DSK install allows missing non-`n:` requirements that composer-based installation would reject.
- Confirmed: runtime binding names silently overwrite across composer and direct install.
- Confirmed: `engine.navigation.requestPath()` queues and returns request objects sharing caller-owned endpoint objects (`src/pathfinding-kit.js:548-565`).
- Confirmed: pathfinding resolution later reads the aliased queued request objects and emits payloads with the mutated `start`/`goal` (`src/pathfinding-kit.js:455-480`).
- Confirmed: `createNavigationQuery().snapshot()`, `.state()`, `.lastPath()`, and `engine.navigation.snapshot()` return live navigation resources (`src/pathfinding-kit.js:388-400`; `src/pathfinding-kit.js:567-568`).
- Confirmed: `createProceduralQuery().snapshot()`, `cellAt()`, and `engine.procedural.snapshot()` expose live procedural snapshot objects (`src/procedural-kit.js:465-500`; `src/procedural-kit.js:590-591`).
- Confirmed: `engine.procedural.regenerate()` returns the same live state object that it stores before generation runs (`src/procedural-kit.js:573-588`).
- Carried: scheduler/world mutation isolation, query read-model, content-boundary/objective, runtime identity/lifecycle, composition-proof ownership, proof-signal, AR/spatial, traversal, source-state, state-signal, receipt, bridge, operations, and spatial rows remain fixture inventory.

## Missing tests
- Reserved `apiName` handling for `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`, inherited keys, and own-property service lookup.
- Null-prototype or reserved-key namespace policy for `engine.n`.
- Failed install rollback/retryability for API collision, `createApi` throw, install hook throw, `initWorld` throw, registry throw, scheduler add throw, sequence runtime throw, and SequenceNode runtime throw.
- Direct install versus composer dependency policy for `n:*`, `runtime:*`, kit ids, and custom capability tokens.
- Duplicate provider-token diagnostics and duplicate binding-name diagnostics with owner lookup and explicit override policy.
- Scheduler active-run mutation, phase topology, `runSystem()` membership, and event queue payload isolation.
- Navigation command payload ownership fixtures for returned request mutation, original endpoint mutation, event payload mutation, queued-state mutation, and agent path assignment.
- Navigation read-model fixtures for `snapshot()`, `query().snapshot()`, `query().state()`, `query().lastPath()`, path history, requests, debug raw graphs, and agent path arrays.
- Procedural snapshot isolation fixtures for cells, walkability cells, regions, render descriptors, objective markers, graph nodes, links, and world positions.
- Procedural `regenerate()` return-value fixtures for `dirty`, seed/config mutation, invalidation event payloads, and same-frame generation.
- Reset/snapshot absence, failure, restore, non-serializable state behavior, and async metadata truth.
- Proof-readiness checks that keep local/fetched/browser/npm/package-version/module-source proof separate from runtime, scheduler/world, procedural/navigation, composition, identity, content-boundary, and query-read-model hardening.

## Promotion risks
- Do not promote broad DSK graphs until runtime failure-boundary fixtures exist for namespace safety, install transaction semantics, dependency parity, scheduler failure lifetime, scheduler/world mutation isolation, event queue isolation, procedural/navigation ownership, and metadata truth.
- Do not treat procedural/navigation snapshots as proof-safe until returned records and nested arrays/objects are isolated or explicitly documented as mutable handles.
- Do not treat navigation commands as replay-safe while caller-owned endpoints remain live after enqueue.
- Do not attach proof dashboards, renderer decorators, AI adapters, or editor tooling to procedural/navigation snapshots without a clone/freeze or mutable-handle policy.
- Do not treat `npm test`, HTTP 200 public routes, aggregate Experiments checks, fetched raw files, public CDN reachability, npm metadata, module-source alignment, or query helper availability as production DSK safety.
- Do not move proof routing, package-resolution shims, browser routes, or reusable gameplay implementation into NexusRealtime core to solve procedural/navigation or distribution proof issues.

## Suggested next review item
- Use a non-scout lane to write the smallest executable tranche 1 fixture set: `engine.n` reserved-key/null-prototype/own-property policy, failed-install rollback/retryability, direct/composer dependency parity, scheduler failed-tick semantics, active-run scheduler mutation, phase topology mutation, `runSystem()` membership, `readEvents()` payload isolation, procedural/navigation request and snapshot ownership, `regenerate()` return-state isolation, and reset/snapshot/async metadata truth.
- After tranche 1 starts, add query read-model isolation fixtures for exported `query*` helpers, engine read methods, nested metadata/hazard clone/freeze behavior, and stored `lastQuery`/`lastCollision` proof snapshots.

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, docs, examples, package metadata, repo memory, public claims, `.agent` files, ProtoKits, Experiments, deployments, or release branches were edited.
- No bugs were fixed.
- No new tests were added.
- Playwright/Human View validation was not run for this DSK architecture scout because this pass had no UI/browser deliverable; neighboring ecosystem state/proof lanes carry current public browser proof status.
- Passing `npm test` does not prove production DSK readiness.
- This packet does not prove browser UX, public proof completion, npm publication, sibling fetched-ref validation, async execution, worker/network readiness, replay/restore support, lifecycle parity, query/command semantics, read-model/orchestration readiness, runtime identity/lifecycle readiness, composition-proof ownership readiness, content-boundary/objective readiness, query-read-model readiness, scheduler/world readiness, procedural/navigation ownership readiness, AR/spatial readiness, proof-signal integrity, proof-readiness taxonomy, or broad domain graph promotion.
