# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem proof scout 2026-06-20T02-40-59-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-proof-026
- statement: Core still matches the preflight-resolved latest release branch and passes smoke tests, while the first-wave DSK proof blocker is unchanged: local/fetched ProtoKits cannot resolve package `nexusrealtime`, local Experiments fails through ProtoKits, fetched Experiments targeted proof fails on sibling paths, and the public browser proof remains stuck at `Booting...`.
- why it matters: The only live change since the previous proof packet is sibling ref drift, especially Experiments `origin/0.0.2` advancing to `81b39bccadf2cdf8269df24cd4970a5b2d7ebbd9`. Promotion still depends on a single module-source strategy that works for local checkouts, disposable release refs, aggregate-vs-targeted validation, and browser loading.

## Child Nodes
- id: ecosystem-proof-026-a
  parent: ecosystem-proof-026
  lesson: Core remains latest-release aligned and smoke-green.
  evidence: Preflight resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; core `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ahead/behind `0 0`; `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
  look further: Keep resolving latest release refs every run because sibling refs continue to drift.
- id: ecosystem-proof-026-b
  parent: ecosystem-proof-026
  lesson: ProtoKits local and fetched proof remain blocked by the direct package import `nexusrealtime`.
  evidence: Local ProtoKits `npm run check` checked 330 JavaScript modules, then failed 110 import smokes rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`; local targeted DSK smoke failed on the same package; fetched `origin/0.0.2` at `b1d69099392a144a999cac824d344c403fe762d8` checked 358 modules and failed the same way.
  look further: Validate ProtoKits with an explicit package, workspace, CDN, or link model that matches intended release consumption.
- id: ecosystem-proof-026-c
  parent: ecosystem-proof-026
  lesson: Experiments latest release ref advanced, but targeted DSK proof is still blocked by sibling-relative imports.
  evidence: Experiments local `HEAD` was `799fad882461502faa84b132f70de011e7dbe0cb`; fetched `origin/0.0.2` advanced to `81b39bccadf2cdf8269df24cd4970a5b2d7ebbd9`; ahead/behind `0 10`; disposable fetched aggregate `npm run check` passed, but targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed on missing `/private/tmp/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  look further: Re-run targeted DSK proof with the same module-source strategy intended for public proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-026-d
  parent: ecosystem-proof-026
  lesson: Public DSK proof remains HTTP-visible but not browser-complete.
  evidence: Curl returned 200 for the proof route; Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and `Booting...`; console output showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.
  look further: Do not treat HTTP 200 on the route as browser proof.
- id: ecosystem-proof-026-e
  parent: ecosystem-proof-026
  lesson: Experiments aggregate validation remains a separate green claim from targeted DSK proof.
  evidence: Disposable fetched Experiments `npm run check` passed and generated 100 flat route wrappers, but `package.json` aggregate script does not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
  look further: Decide whether the DSK smoke belongs in `npm run check`, `npm run check:deploy`, or required targeted evidence.
- id: ecosystem-proof-026-f
  parent: ecosystem-proof-026
  lesson: Composition-proof ownership is new neighboring inventory, but it does not change distribution proof status.
  evidence: DSK architecture node `2026-06-20T02-23-35-0400`, deep bug node `2026-06-20T01-55-55-0400`, and domain idea node `2026-06-20T02-01-55-0400` add provider ownership, SequenceNode type/history isolation, and AR runtime-source consistency as hardening rows separate from module-source proof.
  look further: Route composition-proof fixtures separately from the module-source/public browser proof lane.
- id: ecosystem-proof-026-g
  parent: ecosystem-proof-026
  lesson: Core/ProtoKits/Experiments ownership boundaries still hold.
  evidence: Repo memory and boundary docs keep core as runtime/DSK/composer owner, ProtoKits as reusable implementation owner, and Experiments as playable/browser proof owner; this run found no reason to move proof routing or reusable implementation into NexusRealtime core.
  look further: Fix proof routing/imports without moving route ownership, reusable implementation, or proof-readiness checklist tooling into NexusRealtime core.
