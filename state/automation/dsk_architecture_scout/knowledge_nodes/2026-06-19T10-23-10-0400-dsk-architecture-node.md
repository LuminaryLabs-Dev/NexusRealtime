# Knowledge Nodes: dsk_architecture_scout 2026-06-19T10-23-10-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: dsk-state-signal-fixture-root-2026-06-19-1023
- statement: DSK remains release-aligned and test-green, but promotion fixtures must now include state-signal contracts: descriptor invalidation, action repeat policy, small state-machine transition receipts, coordinate-axis policy, and derived-state boundaries alongside namespace, install, dependency, state-contract, service-call, operations data, spatial/mobility, receipt, bridge, wrapper-state, and source-state gates.
- why it matters: Fresh live probes show reusable services can preserve public shape while suppressing needed rebuilds, repeating one-shot actions, starting in contradictory terminal states, ignoring common world coordinates, or mutating source view state; those failures undermine replay, proof rows, async partitioning, and broad DSK promotion claims.

  parent: dsk-state-signal-fixture-root-2026-06-19-1023
  lesson: Core still matches the latest release branch, so the state-signal conclusion is not caused by branch drift.
  evidence: `npm run automation:preflight` resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ahead/behind was `0 0`; `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
  look further: Keep resolving latest release branch every run and treat old packet commit hashes as context only.
- id: dsk-install-hardening-unchanged-2026-06-19-1023
  parent: dsk-state-signal-fixture-root-2026-06-19-1023
  lesson: Namespace, failed-install transaction, and direct dependency policy blockers remain unchanged on the live checkout.
  evidence: `src/domain-service-kit.js:143-161` still uses plain-object `engine.n` and late API assignment; `src/runtime-kit.js:135-157` still records DSK metadata and pushes kits before late install hooks; `src/runtime-kit.js:142-145` still filters missing direct DSK requirements to `n:` tokens; probe returned `protoOwn:false`, retained `n-late-collision-kit` after collision, and installed a kit requiring missing `runtime:needed`.
  look further: Add fixtures for reserved API names, install rollback, and direct-install dependency policy before new DSK promotion claims.
- id: dsk-descriptor-invalidation-gap-2026-06-19-1023
  parent: dsk-state-signal-fixture-root-2026-06-19-1023
  lesson: Descriptor-producing services need rebuild signatures based on output-affecting content and config, not only counts.
  evidence: `src/forest-placement-kit.js:154-168` keys by `routeLength` while descriptors and snapshots depend on route coordinates; probe changed a same-length route from z `0` to z `80`, but snapshot version stayed `1` and route stayed `[0,0]`.
  look further: Add fixtures for route content, filter/config, terrain query identity, and output-affecting descriptor signatures.
- id: dsk-action-repeat-policy-gap-2026-06-19-1023
  parent: dsk-state-signal-fixture-root-2026-06-19-1023
  lesson: Service actions need explicit edge, held, repeatable, ignored, and duplicate-attempt semantics.
  evidence: `src/interaction-kit.js:49-60` emits gather/activate whenever held booleans stay true; probe emitted gathered counts `[1]`, `[2]` and repeated activation for `switch` across two ticks.
  look further: Decide whether one-shot service actions suppress repeats, emit duplicate receipts, or opt into held-continuous behavior by config.
- id: dsk-state-machine-transition-gap-2026-06-19-1023
  parent: dsk-state-signal-fixture-root-2026-06-19-1023
  lesson: Small state-machine kits need false-to-true transition receipts plus initial terminal normalization.
  evidence: `src/shrine-puzzle-kit.js:23-26` emits `ShrineCharged` on every qualifying tick; `src/light-combat-kit.js:42-49` can initialize `enemyHealth:0` with `enemyDefeated:false`; probe returned charged batches `[1,1]` and contradictory initial combat state.
  look further: Add transition-only and initial-terminal rows for puzzle, combat, objective, pressure, recovery, and proof domains.
- id: dsk-coordinate-axis-policy-gap-2026-06-19-1023
  parent: dsk-state-signal-fixture-root-2026-06-19-1023
  lesson: Validation and mobility helpers need a shared coordinate-axis contract across `{ x, y }` route points and `{ x, z }` world points.
  evidence: `src/scenario-driver-kit.js:19-27` uses `x` and `y` only; probe returned zero vector and `boost:false` for an `{ x, z }` target.
  look further: Normalize `z ?? y`, split 2D and 3D APIs, or require explicit point-shape declarations before route/mobility proof rows are trusted.
- id: dsk-derived-state-boundary-gap-2026-06-19-1023
  parent: dsk-state-signal-fixture-root-2026-06-19-1023
  lesson: Presentation and safety services need source-versus-derived state boundaries.
  evidence: `src/camera-occlusion-kit.js:84-88` mutates source `cameraState.lookAt.y` during terrain-line adjustment; probe moved lookAt y from `0` to `1.87875` to `3.226753125` across ticks.
  look further: Publish derived output paths, require upstream recomputation, or declare mutable source state before camera/render safety services are promoted.
- id: dsk-proof-boundary-still-separated-2026-06-19-1023
  parent: dsk-state-signal-fixture-root-2026-06-19-1023
  lesson: State-signal hardening remains separate from public browser proof, aggregate validation, latest-ref Experiments proof, npm availability, and package-version policy.
  evidence: Ecosystem state node `2026-06-19T10-10-19-0400` keeps public proof stuck at `Booting...`, aggregate DSK smoke omitted, Experiments latest-ref validation open, npm metadata 404, and branch/package policy unresolved.
  look further: Keep runtime hardening fixtures, targeted proof, aggregate validation, public browser proof, and distribution evidence as separate categories.
