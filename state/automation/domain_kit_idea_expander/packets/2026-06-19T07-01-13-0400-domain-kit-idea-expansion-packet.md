# Domain And Kit Idea Expansion Packet: 2026-06-19T07-01-13-0400

## Timestamp
- local: 2026-06-19T07-01-13-0400
- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-19-0600`.
- Latest current-lane packet added spatial/mobility invariant planning inventory around transition-state policy, immediate-threshold policy, hazard identity, resource-bound normalization, and proof rows.
- Latest ecosystem state and proof packets say core is release-aligned on `0.0.2`, available-checkout validation is green, sibling repos are clean but behind fetched release refs, public browser proof still stalls at `Booting...`, aggregate DSK smoke coverage remains incomplete, and npm metadata remains 404.
- Latest DSK architecture packet says DSK promotion still needs namespace, install, dependency, state-contract, service-call, operations data, and spatial/mobility hardening fixtures.
- Latest deep bug packet adds timing/action receipt identity, interaction completion idempotency, collectible claim idempotency, and generated request identity gaps.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, source snippets, and preflight results were treated as authority for this run.

## Latest branch
- preflight command: `npm run automation:preflight`
- latest remote release branch: `0.0.2`
- compare target: `0.0.2`
- branch status: `current-is-latest-release-branch`
- required public links: pass
- optional npm metadata: 404

## Ideas added
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`
  - Receipt Integrity Domain for stable action/result receipt ids, transition-only event emission, duplicate-claim policy, and generated request identity.
- `docs/kits_ideas.md`
  - `receipt-identity-kit`
  - `event-idempotency-kit`
  - `claim-receipt-policy-kit`
  - `request-identity-policy-kit`
  - `receipt-integrity-proof-kit`
- `docs/described_examples.md`
  - Receipt Integrity Harness joining timing, interaction, reward, request, telemetry, and proof services.

## Ideas deferred
- Direct source fixes for TimingWindowKit, InteractionTargetKit, CollectibleKit, and RequestFulfillmentKit were deferred because this lane cannot edit source or tests.
- A new general Stable Identity Domain was not added because Operations Data Integrity Domain and `stable-id-allocation-kit` already cover broad generated identity. This run adds only request-specific policy and receipt attribution.
- A new general Accepted Mutation Domain was not added because it already exists. Receipt Integrity is scoped to result identity and emitted-event idempotency after or around mutation policy.
- Public proof route import-map and aggregate DSK smoke work were deferred because they belong to proof/experiment lanes, not this idea lane.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate Accepted Mutation Domain; the new domain focuses on stable receipt identity and event surfaces, not validate-before-mutate policy.
- Did not duplicate `completion-idempotency-kit`; `event-idempotency-kit` broadens transition-only emission to interaction, collectible, request, and proof events while depending on completion idempotency where completion semantics apply.
- Did not duplicate `stable-id-allocation-kit`; `request-identity-policy-kit` is a request/logistics adapter over authored, restored, and manual request ids.
- Did not duplicate Proof Surface Domain or `proof-coverage-matrix-kit`; `receipt-integrity-proof-kit` narrows proof rows to action receipt, event idempotency, claim, and request identity checks.

## DSK boundary notes
- Receipt identity should keep result ids separate from query/window/object ids so telemetry and replay do not conflate action receipts with state snapshots.
- Event idempotency should define whether repeats are silent, rejected, or emitted as explicit already-complete or already-claimed receipts.
- Request identity should reuse general allocation policy where possible but expose request-specific creation, completion, expiry, reward, and route attribution.
- Receipt Integrity should start as ProtoKit planning inventory unless core needs reusable DSK fixture helpers for event idempotency or receipt identity.

## Open questions
- Should `receipt-identity-kit` be a standalone DSK or a fixture pattern required for timing, interaction, reward, and request domains?
- Should duplicate completion/claim attempts be silent, rejected, or returned as already-complete/already-claimed receipts?
- Should request id allocation live entirely in `stable-id-allocation-kit`, or should request/logistics expose a domain-specific adapter for proof attribution?
- Should receipt-integrity proof rows stay local until the public first-wave proof route loads, or be added to targeted command proof first?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, or `.agent` files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route was fixed.
- No npm publication or deployment was performed.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
