- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-19-0900`.
- Latest current-lane packet added Source State Integrity Domain, authored-source isolation, reset-source policy, retention-limit policy, initial-terminal receipts, and source-state proof inventory.
- Latest ecosystem state packet says core and ProtoKits remain release-aligned and validation-green, while Experiments latest-ref validation, public browser proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy, and DSK hardening/source-state gates remain open.
- Latest DSK architecture packet says source-state integrity now joins namespace, install, dependency, state-contract, service-call, operations, spatial/mobility, receipt, bridge, step, and wrapper-state promotion gates.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet says core and ProtoKits are latest-ref aligned and validation-green, but Experiments is still behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`, public browser proof remains stuck at `Booting...`, and source-state hardening constrains promotion claims.
- Latest deep bug packet adds signal/state-contract gaps: ForestPlacement count-only invalidation, Interaction held repeat events, Shrine/LightCombat transition and initial terminal contradictions, ScenarioDriver `{ x, z }` steering loss, and CameraOcclusion cumulative `lookAt` mutation.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, source snippets, preflight, and direct file inspection were treated as authority for this run.

## Ideas added
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`
  - State Signal Contract Domain for descriptor invalidation, edge/held/repeat action semantics, small state-machine transition receipts, coordinate-axis policy, and source-versus-derived state ownership.
- `docs/kits_ideas.md`
  - `descriptor-invalidation-kit`
  - `action-repeat-policy-kit`
  - `state-machine-transition-kit`
  - `coordinate-axis-policy-kit`
  - `derived-state-boundary-kit`
  - `state-signal-contract-proof-kit`
- `docs/described_examples.md`
  - State Signal Contract Harness joining invalidation, action semantics, state-machine transition, coordinate, derived-state, and proof domains.

## Ideas deferred
- Direct fixes for ForestPlacementKit, InteractionKit, ShrinePuzzleKit, LightCombatKit, ScenarioDriverKit, and CameraOcclusionKit were deferred because this lane cannot edit source or tests.
- A second Input Semantics Domain was not added because input-edge semantics already exist; this run narrows to action repeat policy at service boundaries and proof receipts.
- A second Receipt Integrity Domain was not added because receipt identity and event idempotency already exist; this run narrows to signal contracts around invalidation, state-machine transitions, coordinate policy, and derived-state boundaries.
- A second Source State Integrity Domain was not added because source/reset isolation already exists; derived-state boundary is scoped to presentation/camera adjustments that should not mutate source targets.
- A broad Presentation Domain rewrite was not added because the latest evidence spans placement, interaction, puzzle/combat, validation, and camera services, not only rendering.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate `input-edge-semantics-kit`; `action-repeat-policy-kit` depends on it and decides edge, held, repeat, duplicate, accepted, and ignored semantics at action-service boundaries.
- Did not duplicate `event-idempotency-kit`; `state-machine-transition-kit` depends on it and narrows to false-to-true receipts plus initial terminal normalization for small state machines.
- Did not duplicate `initial-terminal-receipt-kit`; `state-machine-transition-kit` consumes initial-terminal policy and applies it to puzzle/combat-style service state.
- Did not duplicate `authored-source-isolation-kit` or `reset-source-policy-kit`; `derived-state-boundary-kit` focuses on source versus derived presentation/view output, not authored dataset cloning.
- Did not duplicate `proof-coverage-matrix-kit`; `state-signal-contract-proof-kit` narrows proof rows to invalidation, action repeats, transitions, coordinates, and derived state.

## DSK boundary notes
- Descriptor invalidation should be ProtoKit planning inventory by default unless core later needs a shared DSK fixture helper for normalized content signatures.
- Action repeat policy should clarify service-level meaning of held input rather than replacing lower-level input edge normalization.
- Coordinate-axis policy should document or adapt `{ x, y }` route-field conventions and `{ x, z }` world/terrain conventions before validation-driver results are treated as proof.
- Derived-state boundary should separate source camera/presentation targets from occlusion-adjusted or renderer-derived output state.
- Core changes would only be appropriate if later implementation exposes missing validation primitives for invalidation signatures, coordinate normalization, or derived-state proof fixtures.

## Open questions
- Should descriptor invalidation signatures be a shared DSK service, a proof fixture convention, or kit-local helpers with standard audit rows?
- Should action repeat policy reject held one-shot actions, emit duplicate-attempt receipts, or allow repeatable actions only by explicit config?
- Should small state-machine transition policy own initial terminal normalization, or only consume `initial-terminal-receipt-kit` results?
- Should coordinate-axis policy normalize `z ?? y`, expose separate 2D and 3D APIs, or require explicit point-shape declarations?
- Should camera occlusion and similar presentation safety services mutate source state, publish derived output, or require upstream camera recomputation before each tick?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, or `.agent` files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route was fixed.
- No Experiments latest-ref validation was performed.
- No npm publication or deployment was performed.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
