# Domain And Kit Idea Expansion Packet: 2026-06-19T21-01-07-0400

## Timestamp

- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-19-2000`.
- Latest current-lane packet added Legacy Sequence And AR Content Compatibility Domain, legacy replay/reset, legacy any cleanup, legacy owning-kit context, AR default text safety, and compatibility/content-safety proof rows.
- Latest ecosystem state packet says core remains current and validation-green, while module-source strategy still blocks ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof, and public browser proof.
- Latest DSK architecture packet keeps runtime failure-boundary first, lifecycle parity second, query/command semantics third, experience-edge fourth, read-model/orchestration fifth, and compatibility/content-safety sixth.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet keeps local, fetched-ref, aggregate, targeted, browser, npm, package-version, hardening, read-model/orchestration, and compatibility/content-safety claims separate.
- Latest deep bug packet adds AR launch and SpatialRoom evidence: missing `createARKit()` precondition, mutable launch support state, silent preferred-mode fallback, and SpatialRoom live getter mutation.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, source snippets, and preflight were treated as authority for this run.

## Ideas added
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`
  - AR Launch And Spatial Read Model Domain for launcher preconditions, preferred-mode fallback policy, launch-state read models, SpatialRoom getter isolation, and AR/spatial proof rows.
- `docs/kits_ideas.md`
  - `ar-launch-precondition-kit`
  - `ar-mode-selection-policy-kit`
  - `ar-launch-state-isolation-kit`
  - `spatial-room-getter-isolation-kit`
  - `ar-spatial-read-model-proof-kit`
- `docs/described_examples.md`
  - AR Launch Spatial Read Model Harness joining launch preconditions, mode selection, launch-state isolation, spatial read models, and proof domains.

## Ideas deferred
- Direct fixes for `src/ar-launcher.js`, `src/ar-device.js`, `src/ar-modes/*`, and `src/spatial-room-kit.js` were deferred because this lane cannot edit source or tests.
- A second Experience Edge Contract Domain was not added because launch fallback already exists there; this pass narrows to AR composition preconditions, explicit preferred-mode policy, and capability-claim labeling.
- A second Query Command Semantics Domain was not added because SpatialRoom getter isolation is a core spatial descriptor read-model issue, not a command/query side-effect family.
- A second Read Model Orchestration Isolation Domain was not added because AR launch callback state and SpatialRoom service getters are AR/spatial proof boundaries, not registry/surface/SequenceNode orchestration rows.
- A second Legacy Sequence And AR Content Compatibility Domain was not added because this pass covers launcher capability and read-model contracts, not AR default text safety.
- Executable fixture work was deferred because this lane is planning inventory only.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate `launch-fallback-chain-kit`; `ar-mode-selection-policy-kit` covers explicit preferred-mode validation and fallback claim labeling, while launch fallback covers start-failure retry order.
- Did not duplicate `surface-snapshot-isolation-kit`; `ar-launch-state-isolation-kit` narrows to launcher `getState()`, `render`, and `onUpdate` snapshots over AR resources and proof panels.
- Did not duplicate `query-snapshot-isolation-kit`; `spatial-room-getter-isolation-kit` narrows to SpatialRoom `getState()`, `getActiveBuilding()`, `getAnchor()`, `setActiveBuilding()`, and `snapshot()` contracts.
- Did not duplicate `ar-default-text-safety-kit`; launcher capability/read-model proof is separate from DOM text-versus-trusted-HTML behavior.
- Did not duplicate `module-source-gate-kit`; these rows do not decide package, CDN, workspace, or same-origin import strategy.

## DSK boundary notes
- These rows are NexusRealtime core validation-surface inventory because the fresh evidence is in exported AR launch, AR device, AR mode, and SpatialRoom primitives.
- The new rows do not imply new reusable gameplay kits; they define validation boundaries for existing core browser/spatial surfaces.
- ProtoKits and Experiments may consume the guarantees later, but implementation belongs in core only if a non-scout lane hardens AR launcher or SpatialRoom behavior.
- Public module-source strategy remains separate; fixing browser imports would not prove launcher preconditions, strict fallback labels, launch-state isolation, or SpatialRoom getter isolation.

## Open questions
- Should `createARLaunchRuntime()` require `createARKit()` up front, install it itself, or return a structured composition error?
- Should explicit `preferredModes` be strict by default, or should fallback be opt-in with clear degraded-capability diagnostics?
- Which launch state fields must be cloned, frozen, or redacted before `render`, `onUpdate`, and `getState()` consumers receive them?
- Should SpatialRoom getters return cloned snapshots, frozen snapshots, or explicitly named mutable handles?
- Should AR launch/spatial read-model rows join the compatibility/content-safety tranche, the read-model/orchestration tranche, or a separate AR/spatial proof group?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, or `.agent` files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route or module-source strategy was fixed.
- No ProtoKits or Experiments fetched-ref validation was performed by this lane.
- No npm publication or deployment was performed.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
