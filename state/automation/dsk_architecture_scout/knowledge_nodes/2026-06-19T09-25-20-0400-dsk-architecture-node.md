# Knowledge Nodes: dsk_architecture_scout 2026-06-19T09-25-20-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: dsk-source-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0925
- statement: DSK remains release-aligned and test-green, but promotion fixtures must now include source-state integrity: authored-source isolation, reset-source guarantees, retention-limit normalization, and initial terminal-state receipts alongside namespace, install, dependency, state-contract, service-call, operations, spatial/mobility, receipt, bridge, step, and wrapper-state gates.
- why it matters: Fresh source and probe evidence shows dataset-heavy services can mutate caller-authored nested config and reset from that mutated source, economy retention can keep evidence when asked to keep none, and pursuit-pressure scenarios can begin terminal by band without terminal or recovery receipts.

  lesson: Core still matches the latest release branch, so the new source-state conclusion is not caused by branch drift.
  evidence: `npm run automation:preflight` resolved `latestReleaseBranch: 0.0.2`; `HEAD` and `origin/0.0.2` both resolved to `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0`; ahead/behind was `0 0`; `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
  look further: Keep resolving latest release branch every run and treat prior packet commit hashes as context only.
- id: dsk-install-hardening-unchanged-2026-06-19-0925
  parent: dsk-source-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0925
  lesson: Namespace, failed-install transaction, and direct dependency policy blockers remain unchanged on the live checkout.
  evidence: `src/domain-service-kit.js:143-161` still uses plain-object `engine.n` and late API assignment; `src/runtime-kit.js:135-157` still records DSK metadata and pushes kits before late install hooks; `src/runtime-kit.js:142-145` still filters missing direct DSK requirements to `n:` tokens; probe returned `own:false`, retained `n-late-collision-kit` after collision, and installed a kit requiring missing `runtime:needed`.
  look further: Add fixtures for reserved API names, install rollback, and direct-install dependency policy before new DSK promotion claims.
- id: dsk-authored-source-isolation-gap-2026-06-19-0925
  parent: dsk-source-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0925
  lesson: Dataset-heavy services need clone/freeze isolation so runtime state cannot mutate caller-authored nested config.
  evidence: `src/water-surface-kit.js:11-25`, `src/route-field-kit.js:11-31`, and `src/render-descriptor-kit.js:10-24` keep nested caller objects; probe changed WaterSurface tags to `["safe","runtime"]`, RouteField tags to `["route","runtime"]`, and RenderDescriptor material tags to `["visual","runtime"]`.
  look further: Add authored-source isolation fixtures for dataset-heavy services before reset, replay, restore, or proof snapshots are trusted.
- id: dsk-reset-source-policy-gap-2026-06-19-0925
  parent: dsk-source-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0925
  lesson: Reset APIs need an explicit source policy that separates authored config, restored state, runtime state, and reset output.
  evidence: `src/water-surface-kit.js:97-99` and `src/route-field-kit.js:78-80` rebuild from captured config; after runtime nested metadata mutation, reset output preserved the mutated tags.
  look further: Add reset-source fixtures that mutate runtime state, reset, and assert caller config plus reset output remain clean or document shared mutable datasets.
- id: dsk-retention-limit-policy-gap-2026-06-19-0925
  parent: dsk-source-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0925
  lesson: Economy, telemetry, and proof-history services need shared zero, negative, and non-finite retention-limit semantics.
  evidence: `src/economy-kit.js:56` applies `.slice(-Number(request.ledgerLimit ?? 120))`; probe showed `ledgerLimit:0` retained one transaction, `transaction-1`.
  look further: Decide whether zero retention means no entries, invalid config, or a documented minimum before ledger/proof rows are promoted.
- id: dsk-initial-terminal-receipt-gap-2026-06-19-0925
  parent: dsk-source-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0925
  lesson: Pressure and recovery domains need initial terminal-state derivation and receipt policy before they gate scenario proof.
  evidence: `src/pursuit-pressure-kit.js:28-42` derives `band` from `startDistance` but sets `caught:false`; probe started `{band:"caught", caught:false, distance:5}`, ticked to `{band:"danger", caught:false, distance:10}`, and observed `caughtBatches:0`, `recoveredBatches:0`.
  look further: Define install/reset receipts or normalized starting state for initially caught/lost/completed services.
- id: dsk-proof-boundary-still-separated-2026-06-19-0925
  parent: dsk-source-state-fixture-root-2026-06-19-0925
  lesson: Source-state hardening remains separate from public browser proof, aggregate validation, and npm/public distribution.
  evidence: Ecosystem state node `2026-06-19T09-12-09-0400` keeps Experiments latest-ref validation, browser-complete public proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy, and DSK hardening/source-state gates open.
  look further: Keep runtime hardening fixtures, targeted proof, aggregate validation, npm availability, and browser-complete public proof as separate evidence categories.
