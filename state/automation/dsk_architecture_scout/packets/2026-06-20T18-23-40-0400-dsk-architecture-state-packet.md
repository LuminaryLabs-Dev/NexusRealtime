- automation: Nexus Realtime: DSK Architecture State Packet

## Lane Goal
- Audit DSK architecture, contracts, invariants, scaling, and promotion risk for long-term NexusRealtime production viability.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `dsk-procedural-navigation-ownership-context-root-2026-06-20-1738`.
- Latest DSK packet kept runtime failure-boundary as tranche 1 and added procedural/navigation command payload ownership, navigation/procedural snapshot isolation, and procedural `regenerate()` return-state isolation.
- Latest ecosystem state node `2026-06-20T18-11-35-0400` says core and ProtoKits remain latest-ref aligned, but module-source strategy still blocks ProtoKits validation, Experiments targeted proof, and public browser proof.
- Latest ecosystem proof node `2026-06-20T06-40-01-0400` keeps local, fetched-ref, aggregate, targeted, browser, npm, package-version, hardening, and proof claims separate.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-20T17-54-14-0400` adds telemetry selected-value snapshots, telemetry path selector isolation, RequestQueue and TransportRoute command metadata ownership, and InputIntent submitted-frame ownership.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-20T18-00-21-0400` maps that evidence into Telemetry Command Evidence Ownership planning inventory.
- State packets were context only. Live source, docs, tests, git refs, preflight, and focused probes were treated as authority.

## DSK contract state
- `defineRuntimeKit()` remains the low-level installable kit primitive for components, resources, events, systems, registries, sequences, SequenceNode fields, bindings, metadata, and install hooks (`src/runtime-kit.js:35-59`).
- `defineDomainServiceKit()` still wraps RuntimeKit with `n:` tokens, stable `n-<domain>-kit` ids, required version/stability metadata, linear execution metadata, and `engine.n.<apiName>` installation (`src/domain-service-kit.js:123-195`).
- DSK metadata still declares async-ready, serializable state, snapshot, and reset expectations while current execution remains scheduler-linear (`src/domain-service-kit.js:131-139`; `README.md:136-140`).
- `engine.n` is still initialized as a normal object and assigned late through the wrapped install hook (`src/domain-service-kit.js:143-161`).
- `installRuntimeKit()` still records DSK metadata, kit bindings, and kit identity before `initWorld`, registry, scheduler, SequenceNode, and install hooks can throw (`src/runtime-kit.js:135-215`).
- Direct DSK installation still checks only missing `n:` requirements, while `createGameKitComposer()` resolves every required token before composition (`src/runtime-kit.js:142-145`; `src/game-kit-composer.js:49-76`).
- Telemetry, RequestQueue, TransportRoute, and InputIntent are core public reusable services exported from `src/index.js`; their command/proof evidence ownership is DSK promotion-adjacent because proof dashboards, replay, automation, and service-command DSKs depend on immutable evidence boundaries.

## Invariant coverage
- Covered by smoke tests: export presence, basic DSK validation, metadata shape, token creation, extension duplicate checks, missing `n:` rejection, normal API installation, serializable snapshot happy path, same-object reinstall idempotency, same-id duplicate rejection, normal API collision throw, and the eight smoke scripts listed in `tests/run-all.mjs`.
- Not covered: reserved API names, own-property namespace policy, failed-install rollback, direct non-`n:` dependency parity, duplicate provider/binding diagnostics, ECS definition-name collision policy, SequenceNode duplicate type policy, install-only kit idempotency, event-history isolation, disposed listener parity, scheduler failed-tick lifetime, active-run scheduler mutation, phase topology mutation, `runSystem()` membership, event payload isolation, reset/snapshot failure, async metadata truth, query read-model isolation, content-boundary/objective rows, procedural/navigation command/snapshot ownership, telemetry proof snapshot isolation, service command payload ownership, and input frame ownership.
- Focused DSK probe evidence:
  - reserved API: `reservedOwn:false`, `reservedKeys:["baseProbe"]`, `inheritedMarker:"__proto__-api"`, `protoMarker:"__proto__-api"`.
  - failed clean API collision: first collision threw, second same-object reinstall returned `n-late-collision-probe-kit`, API owner stayed `base`, and `engine.kits`/`engine.domainServiceKits` retained the failed kit.
  - dependency parity: direct install with `requires:["runtime:missing"]` installed `n-needs-runtime-probe-kit`, while composer rejected the same graph as unresolved.
  - binding ownership: composer and engine both kept duplicate binding `service` from second kit `binding-b`.
- Focused telemetry/command evidence:
  - mutating a live selected resource after a telemetry tick changed the previously stored snapshot value from `1` to `2`.
  - mutating `lastSnapshot.values.probe.list[0].id` changed the live source resource list id.
  - mutating a telemetry path snapshot changed the source nested value to `99`.
  - mutating original RequestQueue command metadata after `requestQueue.add()` changed stored state to `44`; mutating the returned state changed stored state to `55`.
  - mutating original TransportRoute call metadata after `transportRoutes.call()` changed eventual `lastArrival.metadata.nested.value` to `88`.
  - mutating original InputIntent metadata changed stored input metadata to `77`; mutating returned input state changed stored input metadata to `88`.

## Domain and kit expansion architecture notes
- Core/ProtoKits/Experiments ownership stayed stable: core owns runtime, ECS, scheduler, DSK contract, composer, stable primitives, and validation surfaces; ProtoKits owns new reusable domain implementations; Experiments owns playable/browser proof (`docs/how-to-protokit.md:7-15`, `docs/how-to-protokit.md:53-68`, `docs/how-to-protokit.md:99-105`).
- Telemetry Command Evidence Ownership is not a new gameplay kit request. It is core validation-surface inventory for existing telemetry, operations, transport, and input APIs (`docs/domain_ideas.md:1257-1286`; `docs/kits_ideas.md:1220-1255`; `docs/described_examples.md:1118-1142`).
- This family extends command/proof ownership after procedural/navigation ownership: procedural/navigation covers generated-world commands and snapshots, while telemetry/command evidence covers selected proof values, service command metadata, returned command state, and submitted input frames.
- Scheduler/world mutation remains lower-level tranche 1 because low-level event queue and scheduler mutation policies affect all higher-level command/proof ownership rows.
- Query read-model isolation remains separate because telemetry/command evidence targets proof capture and command submission boundaries, not public read-only helper outputs.
- Public module-source strategy remains an ecosystem/proof decision. Fixing package/import paths would not prove telemetry history, command metadata, or input frame ownership.

## Scaling risks
- Broad DSK promotion still increases collision, inherited-key, and ownership risks while `engine.n` is a normal object.
- Partial installs can leave DSK metadata, kit identity, bindings, world mutations, registries, systems, sequence runtimes, or service APIs inconsistent after late throws.
- Direct install and composer dependency behavior can diverge for the same dependency-bearing DSK graph.
- Duplicate provider tokens and binding names can make large graphs appear satisfied while ownership is ambiguous or last-writer-wins.
- Telemetry history can look like proof while later runtime/resource mutations rewrite prior selected values.
- Telemetry path selectors can turn diagnostic reads into live runtime writes.
- Service commands that retain caller-owned metadata can make queue, transport, request, operations, and service-flow proof non-replay-safe.
- Input submissions that return live state can let a host mutate the current input frame after submission without another command.
- Local/fetched/public DSK proof can regress independently of core smoke tests when module-source policy is implicit.

## Bug candidates
- Confirmed: reserved `apiName:"__proto__"` installs through prototype behavior without an own `engine.n` slot.
- Confirmed: failed late API collision is non-atomic and same-object reinstall returns success without installing the promised API.
- Confirmed/design gap: direct DSK install allows missing non-`n:` requirements that composer-based installation would reject.
- Confirmed: runtime binding names silently overwrite across composer and direct install.
- Confirmed: `createTelemetryKit()` assigns selected resource/path values directly into snapshots and history (`src/telemetry-kit.js:21-33`, `src/telemetry-kit.js:47-52`, `src/telemetry-kit.js:64-72`).
- Confirmed: telemetry path selectors return nested live objects from resources (`src/telemetry-kit.js:6-10`, `src/telemetry-kit.js:26-28`).
- Confirmed: `RequestQueue.add()` keeps caller-owned metadata and returns live queue state (`src/request-queue-kit.js:13-24`, `src/request-queue-kit.js:76-78`, `src/request-queue-kit.js:139-147`).
- Confirmed: `TransportRoute.call()` keeps caller-owned metadata into waiting calls, arrivals, and emitted arrival payloads (`src/transport-route-kit.js:44-51`, `src/transport-route-kit.js:83-85`, `src/transport-route-kit.js:110-113`).
- Confirmed: `InputIntent.set()` keeps caller-owned metadata, emits normalized live intent references, and returns the same live stored state (`src/input-intent-kit.js:13-23`, `src/input-intent-kit.js:50-64`).
- Carried: scheduler/world mutation isolation, procedural/navigation ownership, query read-model, content-boundary/objective, runtime identity/lifecycle, composition-proof ownership, proof-signal, AR/spatial, traversal, source-state, state-signal, receipt, bridge, operations, and spatial rows remain fixture inventory.

## Missing tests
- Reserved `apiName` handling for `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`, inherited keys, and own-property service lookup.
- Null-prototype or reserved-key namespace policy for `engine.n`.
- Failed install rollback/retryability for API collision, `createApi` throw, install hook throw, `initWorld` throw, registry throw, scheduler add throw, sequence runtime throw, and SequenceNode runtime throw.
- Direct install versus composer dependency policy for `n:*`, `runtime:*`, kit ids, and custom capability tokens.
- Duplicate provider-token diagnostics and duplicate binding-name diagnostics with owner lookup and explicit override policy.
- Scheduler active-run mutation, phase topology, `runSystem()` membership, and event queue payload isolation.
- Procedural/navigation request and snapshot ownership fixtures for returned request mutation, original endpoint mutation, navigation snapshots, procedural snapshots, and `regenerate()` return-state isolation.
- Telemetry proof snapshot clone/freeze fixtures for whole resources, nested paths, manual snapshots, cleanup snapshots, history mutation, and source-resource mutation through snapshot values.
- RequestQueue and TransportRoute command payload ownership fixtures for original object mutation, returned state mutation, metadata mutation, event payload mutation, and replay determinism.
- InputIntent fixtures for submitted metadata cloning, returned state mutation, emitted payload mutation, and per-frame immutable input snapshots.
- Reset/snapshot absence, failure, restore, non-serializable state behavior, and async metadata truth.
- Proof-readiness checks that keep local/fetched/browser/npm/package-version/module-source proof separate from runtime, scheduler/world, procedural/navigation, telemetry/command, composition, identity, content-boundary, and query-read-model hardening.

## Promotion risks
- Do not promote broad DSK graphs until runtime failure-boundary fixtures exist for namespace safety, install transaction semantics, dependency parity, scheduler failure lifetime, scheduler/world mutation isolation, event queue isolation, procedural/navigation ownership, telemetry/command evidence ownership, and metadata truth.
- Do not treat telemetry history as release proof while snapshots retain live resource/path references.
- Do not treat service command receipts as replay-safe while submitted metadata can mutate queued work or arrival proof after command submission.
- Do not treat input frames as deterministic replay evidence while returned state and caller-owned metadata can mutate the current frame after submission.
- Do not attach proof dashboards, SequenceNode bridges, AI adapters, replay harnesses, or editor tools to telemetry/command outputs without a clone/freeze or documented mutable-handle policy.
- Do not treat `npm test`, HTTP 200 public routes, aggregate Experiments checks, fetched raw files, public CDN reachability, npm metadata, module-source alignment, or query helper availability as production DSK safety.
- Do not move proof routing, package-resolution shims, browser routes, or reusable gameplay implementation into NexusRealtime core to solve telemetry/command or distribution proof issues.

## Suggested next review item
- Use a non-scout lane to write the smallest executable tranche 1 fixture set: `engine.n` reserved-key/null-prototype/own-property policy, failed-install rollback/retryability, direct/composer dependency parity, scheduler failed-tick semantics, active-run scheduler mutation, phase topology mutation, `runSystem()` membership, `readEvents()` payload isolation, procedural/navigation request and snapshot ownership, telemetry selected-value/path snapshot ownership, RequestQueue/TransportRoute command metadata ownership, InputIntent frame ownership, and reset/snapshot/async metadata truth.
- After tranche 1 starts, add query read-model isolation fixtures for exported `query*` helpers, engine read methods, nested metadata/hazard clone/freeze behavior, and stored `lastQuery`/`lastCollision` proof snapshots.

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, docs, examples, package metadata, repo memory, public claims, `.agent` files, ProtoKits, Experiments, deployments, or release branches were edited.
- No bugs were fixed.
- No new tests were added.
- Playwright/Human View validation was not run for this DSK architecture scout because this pass had no UI/browser deliverable; neighboring ecosystem state/proof lanes carry current public browser proof status.
- Passing `npm test` does not prove production DSK readiness.
- This packet does not prove browser UX, public proof completion, npm publication, sibling fetched-ref validation, async execution, worker/network readiness, replay/restore support, lifecycle parity, query/command semantics, read-model/orchestration readiness, runtime identity/lifecycle readiness, composition-proof ownership readiness, content-boundary/objective readiness, query-read-model readiness, scheduler/world readiness, procedural/navigation ownership readiness, telemetry/command evidence ownership readiness, AR/spatial readiness, proof-signal integrity, proof-readiness taxonomy, or broad domain graph promotion.
