# Ecosystem Proof State Packet

Timestamp: 2026-06-20T02:40:59-0400
Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem Proof State Packet
Scope: NexusRealtime core, NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, NexusRealtime-Experiments
Result: partial; core remains aligned and smoke-green, but DSK ecosystem proof remains blocked by one unresolved module-source strategy across local, fetched-ref, and public browser proof.

## Lane Goal
- Audit proof coverage across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, public routes, and DSK expansion ideas.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `ecosystem-proof-025`.
- Latest proof packet/node `2026-06-20T01-59-45-0400` established that local ProtoKits, local Experiments targeted DSK proof, ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof, and public browser proof all fail around `nexusrealtime` package or sibling module resolution.
- Latest ecosystem state packet/node `2026-06-20T01-59-37-0400` recorded the same local available-checkout regression and kept npm/package-version/public route claims separate.
- Latest DSK architecture packet/node `2026-06-20T02-23-35-0400` added composition-proof ownership rows, but kept them separate from distribution/module-source proof.
- Latest deep bug packet/node `2026-06-20T01-55-55-0400` added duplicate capability providers, SequenceNode duplicate type overwrite, mutable event history, and AR launch device-source mismatch as runtime hardening inputs.
- Latest domain idea packet/node `2026-06-20T02-01-55-0400` mapped those runtime findings to a Composition Proof Ownership family, not to a distribution-proof fix.
- State packets were context only. Live source, docs, tests, git refs, public URLs, preflight, and Playwright launch state are authority for this run.

## ProtoKits migration state
- First-wave DSK ledger remains public on raw `0.0.2`.
- `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js` imports `nexusrealtime` directly as a package.
- ProtoKits `package.json` remains `@luminarylabs/nexusrealtime-protokits@0.0.2` and does not declare a dependency that makes package `nexusrealtime` resolvable in the local or disposable release-ref checkouts.
- `tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` also imports `nexusrealtime` directly before reaching first-wave assertions.
- Direct-import aliases remain present in the first-wave test: `createNZoneFieldKit`, `createNScanSurveyKit`, `createNRouteCheckpointKit`, `createNResourcePressureKit`, `createNHazardDirectorKit`, `createNTokenRegistryKit`, and `createNCompletionLedgerKit`.
- Local available-checkout aggregate and targeted DSK proof remain blocked by the same package-resolution issue.
- Fetched ProtoKits `origin/0.0.2` remains 31 commits ahead of local and fails standalone validation on the same missing package.
- Compatibility shim risk remains: old injected-runtime and legacy `engine.*` APIs are intentional migration support, but no removal condition was found in this scout pass.

## Experiment proof state
- Local targeted DSK proof still fails in the available Experiments checkout through sibling ProtoKits because package `nexusrealtime` is not resolvable.
- The available Experiments checkout is now 10 commits behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`, so local targeted proof is neither green nor latest-ref proof.
- Fetched Experiments aggregate `npm run check` passed in a disposable extraction at `81b39bccadf2cdf8269df24cd4970a5b2d7ebbd9`, including `tropical-island-scene-static-smoke` and 100 generated flat route wrappers.
- Fetched Experiments aggregate still does not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- Fetched Experiments targeted DSK proof failed in a disposable extraction for the sibling relative-path assumption used by the public browser route.
- Public proof route loads HTML but remains human-visible stuck at `Booting...`.
- Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and `Booting...`; console output showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.
- Local proof files still import from sibling relative paths:
  - import map maps `nexusrealtime` to `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  - `src/proof.js` imports `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  - `src/proof.js` imports ProtoKits from `../../../../NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/...`.

## Domain and kit proof coverage
- Core DSK API smoke remains green through `tests/domain-service-kit-smoke.mjs` as part of core `npm test`.
- ProtoKits first-wave service coverage is blocked locally and at the fetched release ref by unresolved `nexusrealtime` package resolution.
- Experiments first-wave proof is blocked locally by ProtoKits package resolution and blocked at fetched-ref/public routes by sibling-relative module paths.
- Fetched Experiments aggregate proof is green for the current aggregate script, but that script omits the DSK first-wave smoke.
- Expanded proof inventory still includes module-source, aggregate-vs-targeted parity, public browser proof, npm availability, package-version policy, proof-readiness queueing, proof-signal integrity, AR/spatial read-model, composition-proof ownership, compatibility/content-safety, read-model/orchestration, lifecycle parity, query/command semantics, experience-edge, runtime failure-boundary, traversal proof integrity, lifecycle/config, source-state integrity, state-signal contracts, bridge-state ownership, receipt integrity, spatial/mobility, operations data, and public distribution categories.

## Runtime ownership drift
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md`, `docs/how-to-experiment.md`, `docs/protokit-boundaries.md`, and `docs/protokit-experiment-loop.md` still keep the core/ProtoKits/Experiments split explicit.
- New reusable kit implementations should target ProtoKits by default.
- New playable/browser proofs should target Experiments by default.
- Core should stay focused on ECS/runtime/DSK/composer primitives, invariants, exports, and validation.
- Current blockers do not justify moving browser routes, reusable implementation, package-resolution shims, or proof-readiness checklist tooling into core.
- Composition-proof ownership, proof-signal integrity, and AR/spatial hardening are validation concerns, but they are separate from the public route import strategy and package-source strategy.

## Broken/stale proof paths
- Broken public proof paths remain:
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`
- Local ProtoKits and Experiments targeted DSK checks fail before proof execution because package `nexusrealtime` is unresolved.
- Disposable latest-ref targeted proof still fails on analogous package/sibling module resolution paths.
- Branch/package mismatch remains: release branch `0.0.2` serves core package version `0.1.0`.
- Optional npm metadata remains 404, so npm-backed consumption is not proven.

## Risks
- A public route returning HTTP 200 can still fail for users if module paths are not deployed.
- Aggregate validation can stay green while omitting the DSK first-wave proof smoke.
- Available-checkout targeted proof can regress independently of core validation when sibling package resolution changes.
- Disposable validation can fail because package/sibling resolution is not modeled; that must be reported separately from source regression.
- Experiments release refs moved during this run, so sibling evidence must keep a fetched-ref timestamp/hash.
- Compatibility shims can blur promoted `engine.n.*` DSK APIs and legacy `engine.*` migration APIs.
- Public consumption language can overclaim if it does not distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch availability from npm registry availability.
- Composition-proof, proof-signal, and AR/spatial hardening rows can improve evidence quality, but fixing them would not prove module-source, npm, package-version, public route, or fetched-ref validation.

## Blockers
- ProtoKits local and fetched `origin/0.0.2` validation need a package/workspace/CDN/link model that resolves `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments local targeted DSK proof needs the sibling ProtoKits package-resolution issue resolved.
- Experiments fetched `origin/0.0.2` needs targeted DSK validation with a sibling layout or revised module-source strategy.
- Public proof import-map/module source strategy remains unresolved: CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, package/workspace dependency, or build-step import mapping.
- `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` is not wired into Experiments aggregate validation or documented as a required targeted command.
- npm metadata for `nexusrealtime` is unavailable.
- Branch `0.0.2` still serves package metadata version `0.1.0`; the release/package-version policy remains unclear.
- DSK promotion hardening lacks executable fixture coverage for runtime failure-boundary, composition-proof ownership, proof-signal, AR/spatial, and earlier rows.

## Suggested next review item
- Define one module-source strategy for `nexusrealtime`, then validate ProtoKits local/fetched package resolution, Experiments local/fetched targeted DSK smoke, and public browser loading against that same model.
