# Ecosystem Proof State Packet

Timestamp: 2026-06-20T05:39:53-0400
Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem Proof State Packet
Scope: NexusRealtime core, NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, NexusRealtime-Experiments
Result: partial; core remains latest-release aligned and smoke-green, ProtoKits now matches fetched `origin/0.0.2`, but first-wave DSK ecosystem proof is still blocked by the same `nexusrealtime` module-source strategy across ProtoKits, Experiments targeted proof, and the public browser route.

## Lane Goal
- Audit proof coverage across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, public routes, and DSK expansion ideas.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `ecosystem-proof-028`.
- Latest proof packet/node `2026-06-20T04-42-18-0400` kept the first-wave DSK blocker on module-source strategy: ProtoKits local/fetched checks could not resolve package `nexusrealtime`, Experiments local/fetched targeted proof failed through package/sibling paths, fetched Experiments aggregate passed, and public browser proof stayed at `Booting...`.
- Latest ecosystem state packet/node `2026-06-20T05-11-41-0400` updated the sibling state: core and ProtoKits matched latest release refs, ProtoKits ref drift closed, but package resolution remained the blocker; Experiments local targeted proof and public proof remained blocked.
- Latest DSK architecture packet/node `2026-06-20T05-24-33-0400` added query read-model isolation as later hardening inventory while keeping module-source proof separate.
- Latest deep bug packet/node `2026-06-20T04-54-16-0400` found public query helper and engine read-method isolation bugs.
- Latest domain idea packet/node `2026-06-20T05-02-13-0400` mapped those bugs into a Query Read Model Isolation family, not a distribution proof fix.
- State packets were context only. Live source, docs, tests, git refs, public URLs, preflight, and Playwright launch state were authority for this run.

## Commands run
- NexusRealtime: `npm run automation:preflight` -> passed; latest branch `0.0.2`; required GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links OK; optional npm metadata 404.
- NexusRealtime: `npm test` -> passed 8 smoke tests.
- NexusRealtime/ProtoKits/Experiments: `git fetch --prune origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2`, `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2`, package metadata checks.
- ProtoKits local/latest-ref: `npm run check` -> failed after checking 370 JavaScript modules; `smoke:imports` reported 110 failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime` from `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js`.
- ProtoKits local/latest-ref: `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` -> failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments local: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` -> failed because sibling ProtoKits imports package `nexusrealtime`, which is not resolvable.
- ProtoKits disposable fetched-ref extraction at `origin/0.0.2` `3d42b725dd166274ff6c5452beef86ef17863852`: `npm run check` -> failed with 110 ProtoKit import smoke failures rooted in missing package `nexusrealtime`.
- ProtoKits disposable fetched-ref targeted DSK smoke: `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` -> failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref extraction at `origin/0.0.2` `3e047f693f3ed58cab1c362deb09a597398d05e5`: `npm run check` -> passed; final line reported flat route smoke passed for 100 generated AAA registry routes.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref targeted DSK smoke: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` -> failed because `experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/src/proof.js` imports `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, resolving to missing `/private/tmp/.../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
- Public URL checks used Node `fetch`.
- Human-view validation used Playwright CLI. Mandatory question: Have I checked what the human would actually see, and do I need screenshots, visual inspection, launch-state inspection, or before/after comparison to validate this properly? Answer: yes; launch-state inspection was required. Snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and visible `Booting...`; console output showed 404s for sibling NexusRealtime and ProtoKits module paths. Playwright scratch artifacts and disposable fetched-ref artifacts were removed.

## ProtoKits migration state
- First-wave DSK ledger remains public on raw `0.0.2`.
- `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js` imports `nexusrealtime` directly as a bare package.
- ProtoKits local checkout now matches fetched `origin/0.0.2` at `3d42b725dd166274ff6c5452beef86ef17863852`, so the local failure is also latest-ref failure.
- Local and fetched ProtoKits package metadata both report `@luminarylabs/nexusrealtime-protokits@0.0.2`, but neither validation path has a package/workspace/CDN/link model that resolves package `nexusrealtime`.
- `tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` imports `nexusrealtime` directly before reaching first-wave assertions.
- Direct-import aliases remain present in the first-wave test and kit exports: `createNZoneFieldKit`, `createNScanSurveyKit`, `createNRouteCheckpointKit`, `createNResourcePressureKit`, `createNHazardDirectorKit`, `createNTokenRegistryKit`, and `createNCompletionLedgerKit`.
- Compatibility shim risk remains: old injected-runtime and legacy `engine.*` APIs are intentional migration support, but no removal condition was found in this scout pass.

## Experiment proof state
- Local targeted DSK proof still fails in the available Experiments checkout through sibling ProtoKits because package `nexusrealtime` is not resolvable.
- The available Experiments checkout is 2 commits behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`, so local targeted proof is not latest-ref proof.
- Fetched Experiments aggregate `npm run check` passed in a disposable extraction at `3e047f693f3ed58cab1c362deb09a597398d05e5`, including the existing static/content route smoke chain and flat route smoke for 100 generated AAA registry routes.
- Fetched Experiments aggregate still does not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.
- Fetched Experiments targeted DSK proof failed in a disposable extraction for the sibling relative-path assumption used by the public browser route.
- Public proof route loads HTML but remains human-visible stuck at `Booting...`.
- Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and `Booting...`; console output showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.
- Local proof files still import from sibling relative paths:
  - import map maps `nexusrealtime` to `../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  - `src/proof.js` imports `../../../../NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
  - `src/proof.js` imports ProtoKits from `../../../../NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/...`.

## Domain and kit proof coverage
- Core DSK API smoke remains green through `tests/domain-service-kit-smoke.mjs` as part of core `npm test`.
- ProtoKits first-wave service coverage is blocked locally and at fetched release ref by unresolved `nexusrealtime` package resolution.
- Experiments first-wave proof is blocked locally by ProtoKits package resolution and blocked at fetched-ref/public routes by sibling-relative module paths.
- Fetched Experiments aggregate proof is green for the current aggregate script, but that script omits the DSK first-wave smoke.
- Expanded proof inventory still includes module-source, aggregate-vs-targeted parity, public browser proof, npm availability, package-version policy, proof-readiness queueing, proof-signal integrity, AR/spatial read-model, composition-proof ownership, runtime identity/lifecycle ownership, content-boundary/objective proof, query read-model isolation, compatibility/content-safety, read-model/orchestration, lifecycle parity, query/command semantics, experience-edge, runtime failure-boundary, traversal proof integrity, lifecycle/config, source-state integrity, state-signal contracts, bridge-state ownership, receipt integrity, spatial/mobility, operations data, and public distribution categories.

## Runtime ownership drift
- `docs/how-to-protokit.md`, `docs/how-to-experiment.md`, `docs/protokit-boundaries.md`, and `docs/protokit-experiment-loop.md` keep the core/ProtoKits/Experiments split explicit.
- New reusable kit implementations should target ProtoKits by default.
- New playable/browser proofs should target Experiments by default.
- Core should stay focused on ECS/runtime/DSK/composer primitives, invariants, exports, and validation.
- Current blockers do not justify moving browser routes, reusable implementation, package-resolution shims, or proof-readiness checklist tooling into core.
- Query read-model isolation, content-boundary/objective, runtime identity/lifecycle ownership, composition-proof ownership, proof-signal integrity, and AR/spatial rows are validation concerns, but they are separate from the public route import strategy and package-source strategy.

## Broken/stale proof paths
- Broken public proof paths remain:
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/NexusRealtime/src/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`
  - `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`
- ProtoKits local/latest-ref targeted DSK checks fail before proof execution because package `nexusrealtime` is unresolved.
- Experiments local targeted proof fails through the sibling ProtoKits package-resolution issue.
- Experiments disposable latest-ref targeted proof still fails on sibling `NexusRealtime/src/index.js` paths.
- Branch/package mismatch remains: core release branch `0.0.2` serves package version `0.1.0`.
- Optional npm metadata remains 404, so npm-backed consumption is not proven.

## Risks
- A public route returning HTTP 200 can still fail for users if module paths are not deployed.
- Aggregate validation can stay green while omitting the DSK first-wave proof smoke.
- ProtoKits ref alignment can look like progress while package resolution still blocks all first-wave DSK assertions.
- Available-checkout targeted proof can regress independently of core validation when sibling package resolution changes.
- Disposable validation can fail because package/sibling resolution is not modeled; that must be reported separately from source regression.
- Compatibility shims can blur promoted `engine.n.*` DSK APIs and legacy `engine.*` migration APIs.
- Public consumption language can overclaim if it does not distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch availability from npm registry availability.
- Query read-model isolation, runtime identity/lifecycle, composition-proof, proof-signal, AR/spatial, and content-boundary/objective hardening rows can improve evidence quality, but fixing them would not prove module-source, npm, package-version, public route, or fetched-ref validation.

## Blockers
- ProtoKits local/latest-ref validation needs a package/workspace/CDN/link model that resolves `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments local targeted DSK proof needs the sibling ProtoKits package-resolution issue resolved.
- Experiments fetched `origin/0.0.2` needs targeted DSK validation with a sibling layout or revised module-source strategy.
- Public proof import-map/module source strategy remains unresolved: CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, package/workspace dependency, or build-step import mapping.
- `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` is not wired into Experiments aggregate validation or documented as a required targeted command.
- npm metadata for `nexusrealtime` is unavailable.
- Core branch `0.0.2` still serves package metadata version `0.1.0`; the release/package-version policy remains unclear.
- DSK promotion hardening lacks executable fixture coverage for runtime failure-boundary, query read-model isolation, runtime identity/lifecycle ownership, composition-proof ownership, proof-signal, AR/spatial, content-boundary/objective, and earlier rows.

## Suggested next review item
- Define one module-source strategy for `nexusrealtime`, then validate ProtoKits local/latest-ref package resolution, Experiments local/fetched targeted DSK smoke, and public browser loading against that same model.
