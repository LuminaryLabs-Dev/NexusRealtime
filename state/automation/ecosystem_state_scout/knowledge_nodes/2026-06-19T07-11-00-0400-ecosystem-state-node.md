# Knowledge Nodes: ecosystem_state_scout 2026-06-19T07-11-00-0400

## Root Lesson
- id: ecosystem-root-009
- statement: Core, ProtoKits, and Experiments are clean and aligned with latest release refs and validation-green, but public browser proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy, and DSK hardening gates remain open.
- why it matters: Promotion review can now stop treating sibling latest-ref drift as the active blocker for this run, but it still needs separate gates for browser-complete public proof, targeted versus aggregate proof, npm/package claims, and DSK runtime invariants.

## Child Nodes
- id: sibling-latest-ref-validation-resolved-2026-06-19-0711
  parent: ecosystem-root-009
  lesson: ProtoKits and Experiments local checkouts are clean and match fetched `origin/0.0.2`.
  evidence: ProtoKits local and origin both resolved to `40d70b93bef6a0e88dadc48067aa4fd2844284f8` with ahead/behind `0 0`; Experiments local and origin both resolved to `6d90b9b01a5aeac0209a2c8f2ce30f670be92a9f` with ahead/behind `0 0`; both status outputs were clean.
  look further: Keep this as a recurring watch, not an active blocker, because sibling branches have drifted across prior runs.
- id: latest-ref-validation-green-2026-06-19-0711
  parent: ecosystem-root-009
  lesson: Current local latest refs pass core, ProtoKits, Experiments aggregate, and targeted first-wave DSK validation.
  evidence: Core `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests; ProtoKits `npm run check` and `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` passed; Experiments `npm run check` and `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed.
  look further: Keep aggregate proof and targeted DSK proof distinct until the targeted smoke is wired into an aggregate command or documented as required evidence.
- id: public-proof-import-shape-2026-06-19-0711
  parent: ecosystem-root-009
  lesson: The public DSK proof route remains HTTP-visible but stuck at `Booting...` in a browser.
  evidence: Playwright snapshot for `https://luminarylabs-agents.github.io/NexusRealtime-Experiments/experiments/dsk-first-wave-proof/` showed `Booting...`; console errors and curl checks showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, `NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-foundation/index.js`, and `NexusRealtime-ProtoKits/protokits/domain-service-kits/index.js`.
  look further: Choose CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or a build-step import map for the public proof route.
- id: aggregate-dsk-proof-validation-2026-06-19-0711
  parent: ecosystem-root-009
  lesson: Experiments aggregate validation still omits the DSK first-wave smoke even though both pass separately.
  evidence: Experiments `package.json` `check` does not list `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`; `npm run check` passed and targeted `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` passed separately.
  look further: Add the DSK smoke to an aggregate check or document the targeted command as required release evidence.
- id: expanded-protokits-proof-coverage-2026-06-19-0711
  parent: ecosystem-root-009
  lesson: Expanded ProtoKits fluid/water/domain surfaces are now included in latest local ProtoKits validation, but this remains local command proof, not browser-complete proof.
  evidence: ProtoKits `package.json` exports fluid/water kits and `npm run check` ran `tests/fluid-water-kits.test.mjs`; public first-wave proof route still fails in-browser.
  look further: Build public or browser-visible proof rows only after first-wave module loading is resolved.
- id: receipt-integrity-hardening-2026-06-19-0711
  parent: ecosystem-root-009
  lesson: Receipt identity and event idempotency now join DSK hardening gates.
  evidence: Deep bug node `2026-06-19T06-53-41-0400` found timing result id overwrite, repeated interaction completion, duplicate collectible claim events, and request generated-id collision; domain idea node `2026-06-19T07-01-13-0400` maps those to receipt integrity planning.
  look further: Add receipt identity, event idempotency, claim policy, and request identity fixture rows before broad timing, interaction, reward, or logistics DSK promotion.
- id: public-consumption-npm-gap-2026-06-19-0711
  parent: ecosystem-root-009
  lesson: GitHub/raw/jsDelivr consumption remains reachable while npm package metadata still returns 404.
  evidence: `npm run automation:preflight` returned 200 for required GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links and 404 for `https://registry.npmjs.org/nexusrealtime`.
  look further: `README.md`, `package.json`, npm publication policy, and public consumption wording.
- id: package-version-policy-2026-06-19-0711
  parent: ecosystem-root-009
  lesson: Release branch `0.0.2` still serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.
  evidence: Local package metadata reports `nexusrealtime@0.1.0`; preflight confirmed raw public `0.0.2/package.json` is reachable.
  look further: Branch naming policy, package version policy, and README release wording.
- id: dsk-hardening-proof-gates-2026-06-19-0711
  parent: ecosystem-root-009
  lesson: DSK promotion gates remain broader than sibling alignment and public module loading.
  evidence: DSK architecture node `2026-06-19T06-24-24-0400` keeps namespace, install, dependency, state-contract, service-call, operations data, spatial/mobility, and resource-bound fixtures open; deep bug and domain idea nodes add receipt integrity.
  look further: Keep public proof loading fixes separate from DSK production-hardening fixture plans.
