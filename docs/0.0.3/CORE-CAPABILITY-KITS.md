# Core Capability Kits

This is the canonical map for the `NexusRealtime` core capability-domain rebuild.

A core capability kit is a stable, configurable domain bubble. It is broader than a tiny helper and smaller than a product/game system.

## Core rule

```txt
Core domains expose composable pieces first.
Umbrella factories are convenience only.
Games and ProtoKits may use individual pieces, umbrella factories, or custom replacements.
```

`src/core-kits/core-capability-kit.js` is the shared helper.

Each `src/core-kits/<core-kit>/index.js` owns its domain factory and exports its local pieces.

`src/core-kits/core-domains.js` is a temporary bridge only.

## Simple ownership map

| Domain | Owns | Does not own |
|---|---|---|
| `core-data-kit` | state, snapshots, selectors, ledgers | storage targets |
| `core-persistence-kit` | save/load adapters and slots | state schema meaning |
| `core-assets-kit` | asset identity and readiness | renderer asset upload |
| `core-platform-kit` | host/device capability descriptors | platform-specific gameplay |
| `core-input-kit` | actions, axes, bindings, contexts | motion or interaction results |
| `core-spatial-kit` | transforms, bounds, zones | scene identity |
| `core-scene-kit` | objects, graph, spawn/despawn | spatial math |
| `core-physics-kit` | colliders, contacts, constraints | full physics engine |
| `core-motion-kit` | movement intent and velocity | raw input devices |
| `core-simulation-kit` | timers, resources, pressure, objectives | game fiction |
| `core-interaction-kit` | targets, affordances, prompts | UI rendering |
| `core-graphics-kit` | presentation descriptors | renderer implementation |
| `core-camera-kit` | camera intent and feel | renderer camera object |
| `core-animation-kit` | animation descriptors/state | renderer mixer |
| `core-audio-kit` | audio cue descriptors | playback backend |
| `core-ui-kit` | UI descriptors | DOM/React/native UI |
| `core-network-kit` | sessions, peers, envelopes | transport provider SDK |
| `core-diagnostics-kit` | telemetry, replay, evidence | vendor observability |
| `core-policy-kit` | permissions and guards | agent planning |
| `core-composition-kit` | kit graph and health | low-level install mechanics |
| `core-mlnn-kit` | model registry and inference descriptors | agent decisions |
| `core-agent-kit` | observations and action proposals | raw model backend loading |
