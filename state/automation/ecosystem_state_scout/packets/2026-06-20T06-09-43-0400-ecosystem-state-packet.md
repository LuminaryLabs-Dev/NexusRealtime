# Ecosystem State Packet: 2026-06-20T06-09-43-0400

## Scope
- Automation: Nexus Realtime: Ecosystem State Packet
- Workspace: `/Users/crimsonwheeler/Documents/GitHub/NexusRealtime`
- Repos checked: NexusRealtime core, NexusRealtime-ProtoKits, NexusRealtime-Experiments
- Result: partial; core and ProtoKits remain latest-release aligned, but package/module-source proof still blocks ProtoKits validation, Experiments targeted proof, and public browser proof.

## Lane Goal
- Audit NexusRealtime ecosystem state, drift, and proof readiness across core, ProtoKits, Experiments, DSK promotion ledgers, branch targets, public links, and proof paths.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `ecosystem-root-028`.
- Latest ecosystem state node `2026-06-20T05-11-41-0400` recorded core and ProtoKits aligned to latest release refs while keeping package/module-source proof open.
- Latest DSK architecture node `2026-06-20T05-24-33-0400` keeps runtime failure-boundary first and query read-model isolation as later hardening inventory.
- Latest ecosystem proof node `2026-06-20T05-39-53-0400` confirms ProtoKits ref drift is closed but local/fetched ProtoKits proof, Experiments targeted proof, public browser proof, npm, and package-version claims remain separate.
- Latest deep bug node `2026-06-20T05-53-01-0400` adds scheduler/world mutation isolation across active scheduler mutation, phase topology, `runSystem()` removed-entity iteration, and `world.readEvents()` payload isolation.
- Latest domain idea node `2026-06-20T06-01-42-0400` maps scheduler/world mutation isolation into planning inventory below query read-model, surface snapshot, runtime identity, content-boundary, and module-source proof rows.
- State packets were context only. Live source, docs, tests, git refs, public URLs, preflight, and Playwright launch state were authority for this run.

## Agent Workspace State
- Read `.agent/start-here.md`, `.agent/operating-model.md`, `.agent/automation-rules.md`, `.agent/report-format.md`, `.agent/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, `.agent/CHANGE_LOG.md`, `memory.md`, and the `agent-it`, `playwright`, and `human-view-orchestrator` skill instructions.
- Root `AGENTS.md` and `goal.md` were absent.
- Agent rules require preflight branch resolution, public-link checks, lane-local evidence, and no source/docs/package/canonical-memory edits from this lane.
- Human-view validation question: Have I checked what the human would actually see, and do I need screenshots, visual inspection, launch-state inspection, or before/after comparison to validate this properly? Yes: the public proof route is launch-state-visible, so Playwright snapshot/console/request inspection was used.
- Worktree had pre-existing modified docs/automation trackers and many untracked automation artifacts before this run. This lane wrote only this packet, its knowledge node, and the lane master tracker update.
- Transient Playwright CLI artifacts created during launch-state inspection were removed after evidence capture.

## Ecosystem Findings
- Core remains current on latest release branch `0.0.2`; `HEAD` equals `origin/0.0.2` and `npm test` passed all 8 smoke tests.
- Required core GitHub/raw/jsDelivr links remain reachable.
- Optional npm registry metadata remains unavailable with HTTP 404, so npm-backed consumption is not proven.
- Branch/package policy remains unresolved: release branch `0.0.2` serves package metadata version `0.1.0`.
- Core has pre-existing tracked planning-doc additions in `docs/described_examples.md`, `docs/domain_ideas.md`, and `docs/kits_ideas.md`; inspected source/test/runtime files had no diff against `origin/0.0.2`.
- ProtoKits local checkout remains clean and aligned with fetched `origin/0.0.2`: both resolve to `3d42b725dd166274ff6c5452beef86ef17863852`, ahead/behind `0 0`.
- ProtoKits package metadata remains `@luminarylabs/nexusrealtime-protokits@0.0.2`.
- ProtoKits `docs/DSK-FIRST-WAVE-LEDGER.md` still lists seven promoted-candidate first-wave kits and says no first-wave kit is half migrated.
- ProtoKits `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js` imports `nexusrealtime` as a bare package.
- ProtoKits local/latest-ref validation remains red: `npm run check` syntax-checked 370 JavaScript modules, then `smoke:imports` failed with 110 ProtoKit index import failures rooted in `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
- ProtoKits local/latest-ref targeted DSK smoke remains red: `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` failed before first-wave assertions with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments local checkout remains clean but behind fetched `origin/0.0.2`: local `57b3d668891794ddad00c765ce4faf342a3d9000`, origin `3e047f693f3ed58cab1c362deb09a597398d05e5`, ahead/behind `0 2`.
- Experiments local targeted DSK validation remains red: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed through local ProtoKits `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js` because package `nexusrealtime` is not resolvable.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref aggregate validation passed: `npm run check` generated 100 flat route wrappers and passed the aggregate smoke chain.
- Experiments disposable fetched-ref targeted DSK validation still failed: `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` could not resolve sibling `/private/.../NexusRealtime/src/index.js` from proof imports.
- Public DSK proof remains HTTP-visible but not browser-complete: Playwright snapshot showed heading `DSK first-wave proof`, description text, and visible `Booting...`; console/request history showed 404s for deployed sibling module paths.
- Experiments aggregate validation remains a separate green claim from targeted DSK proof; `package.json` aggregate `check` does not include `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs`.

## Domain And Kit Expansion Signals
- Core/ProtoKits/Experiments ownership remains stable: core owns runtime/DSK/composer primitives and invariants, ProtoKits owns reusable implementations, and Experiments owns playable/browser proof.
- Query read-model isolation remains useful hardening inventory, but it does not change public/module-source proof status.
- New scheduler/world mutation isolation rows add active scheduler run policy, phase topology, `runSystem()` membership, and event queue payload isolation as lower-level runtime hardening inventory.
- Scheduler/world mutation rows are core validation-surface concerns, not public proof fixes and not new gameplay ProtoKit implementation requests.
- The active ecosystem blocker remains one module-source strategy that works for local/latest-ref ProtoKits, local Experiments targeted proof, fetched Experiments targeted proof, aggregate-vs-targeted proof, and public browser loading.

## Evidence
- `npm run automation:preflight` passed and resolved latest branch `0.0.2`.
- Core `git rev-parse HEAD origin/0.0.2` returned `96a0c16340c50832cdb5c4c81101b87b3f0c6fa0` for both refs.
- Core `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/0.0.2` returned `0 0`.
- Core `npm test` passed 8 smoke tests.
- Core `git diff --stat origin/0.0.2 -- src tests docs README.md package.json memory.md` showed only pre-existing additions in `docs/described_examples.md`, `docs/domain_ideas.md`, and `docs/kits_ideas.md`.
- ProtoKits `git fetch --prune origin`, status, rev-parse, and ahead/behind checks showed local and origin both at `3d42b725dd166274ff6c5452beef86ef17863852`, ahead/behind `0 0`.
- ProtoKits local/latest-ref `npm run check` failed after 370 syntax-checked modules with 110 import-smoke failures rooted in missing package `nexusrealtime`.
- ProtoKits local/latest-ref `node tests/dsk-first-wave.test.mjs` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime`.
- Experiments `git fetch --prune origin`, status, rev-parse, and ahead/behind checks showed local `57b3d668891794ddad00c765ce4faf342a3d9000`, origin `3e047f693f3ed58cab1c362deb09a597398d05e5`, and ahead/behind `0 2`.
- Experiments local `node tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for package `nexusrealtime` from local ProtoKits `protokits/nexus-dsk-adapter/index.js`.
- Experiments disposable fetched `origin/0.0.2` at `3e047f693f3ed58cab1c362deb09a597398d05e5` passed `npm run check` and failed targeted DSK smoke on missing sibling `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`.
- Fetch checks confirmed proof route/raw/CDN files remain public, while runtime dependency paths used by the public page remain 404.
- Playwright CLI opened the public DSK proof route; snapshot showed `Booting...`; console/request history showed 404s for `NexusRealtime/src/index.js`, ProtoKits `domain-foundation`, and ProtoKits `domain-service-kits`.

## Suggested Canonical Updates
- Pick one module-source strategy for release proof: package/workspace dependency, CDN `0.0.2`, same-origin deployed assets, or build-step import maps.
- Make ProtoKits declare or model `nexusrealtime` resolution explicitly before treating local/latest-ref ProtoKits validation as release evidence.
- Validate Experiments targeted DSK proof locally and from fetched `origin/0.0.2` with the same module-source strategy intended for public proof.
- Wire `tests/dsk-first-wave-experiment-smoke.mjs` into aggregate Experiments validation or document it as required targeted evidence.
- Update public consumption wording or release policy so docs distinguish GitHub/jsDelivr branch consumption from unavailable npm registry metadata.
- Decide whether core branch `0.0.2` serving package version `0.1.0` is intentional policy or stale metadata.
- Keep query read-model isolation and scheduler/world mutation isolation separate from public module-loading proof.

## Knowledge Nodes
- Wrote `state/automation/ecosystem_state_scout/knowledge_nodes/2026-06-20T06-09-43-0400-ecosystem-state-node.md`.
- New root lesson: core and ProtoKits remain latest-ref aligned, but module-source strategy still blocks ProtoKits validation, Experiments targeted proof, and public browser proof; scheduler/world mutation isolation is fresh neighboring hardening inventory, not a distribution proof fix.

## Master Tracker Updates
- Added `ecosystem-root-029`.
- Marked `ecosystem-root-028` as superseded by `ecosystem-root-029`.
- Added child branches for current core stability, ProtoKits package resolution, Experiments targeted proof, public browser proof, aggregate-vs-targeted proof, package-version policy, and scheduler/world mutation hardening separation.
