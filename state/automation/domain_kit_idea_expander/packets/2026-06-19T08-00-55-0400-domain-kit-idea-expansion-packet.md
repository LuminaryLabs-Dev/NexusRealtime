# Domain And Kit Idea Expansion Packet: 2026-06-19T08-00-55-0400

## Timestamp
- local: 2026-06-19T08-00-55-0400
- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-19-0701`.
- Latest current-lane packet added Receipt Integrity Domain, receipt identity, event idempotency, claim receipt policy, request identity policy, and receipt integrity proof inventory.
- Latest ecosystem state packet says core, ProtoKits, and Experiments are clean/aligned on latest release refs and validation-green, while public browser proof, aggregate DSK smoke coverage, npm metadata, package-version policy, and DSK hardening gates remain open.
- Latest DSK architecture packet says receipt identity, event idempotency, claim policy, and request identity now join namespace, install, dependency, state-contract, service-call, operations data, and spatial/mobility fixture gates.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet says local latest-ref proof is green but public proof still stalls at `Booting...`, aggregate DSK proof remains separate, and DSK hardening is distinct from browser proof.
- Latest deep bug packet adds bridge phase and wrapper state ownership gaps: SurfacePlacement raw AR anchor events miss ObjectiveFlow, ObjectiveFlow/ARExperience step-completion events do not emit, and several puzzle/platformer wrapper states stay inert after delegated actions.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, source snippets, and preflight results were treated as authority for this run.

## Ideas added
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`
  - Bridge State Ownership Domain for phase-safe event bridges, direct-service versus event-relay policy, step transition receipts, delegated-action reconciliation, and truthful wrapper state contracts.
- `docs/kits_ideas.md`
  - `bridge-phase-policy-kit`
  - `step-transition-receipt-kit`
  - `delegated-action-reconciliation-kit`
  - `wrapper-state-contract-kit`
  - `bridge-state-proof-kit`
- `docs/described_examples.md`
  - Bridge State Ownership Harness joining bridge phase, step receipt, delegated action, wrapper state, telemetry, and proof services.

## Ideas deferred
- Direct fixes for SurfacePlacementKit, ObjectiveFlowKit, ARExperienceKit, puzzle wrappers, and MicroPlatformerKit were deferred because this lane cannot edit source or tests.
- A broader Event Handoff Domain was not added because it already exists; this run narrows the new inventory to phase-safe bridge ownership and advertised wrapper state contracts.
- A broader Receipt Integrity Domain was not duplicated because the new step receipt kit focuses on transition receipts emitted by multi-step flows, not action result ids, claim receipts, or request ids.
- A general Puzzle Domain was not added because the latest evidence is about adapter state truthfulness across several wrappers, not a new product-specific puzzle family.
- Public proof route import-map/module-source work was deferred because it belongs to proof/experiment lanes, not this idea lane.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate `event-handoff-kit`; `bridge-phase-policy-kit` depends on it and narrows to scheduler phase compatibility and direct-service fallback decisions.
- Did not duplicate `event-idempotency-kit`; `step-transition-receipt-kit` covers incomplete-to-complete step transitions and final-step receipts.
- Did not duplicate `receipt-identity-kit`; delegated action and step receipt ideas can require receipt identity without owning general action/result id policy.
- Did not duplicate `composition-audit-kit`; `wrapper-state-contract-kit` narrows audit rows to stateful versus stateless adapter declarations and wrapper-owned snapshot paths.
- Did not duplicate Proof Surface Domain or `proof-coverage-matrix-kit`; `bridge-state-proof-kit` narrows proof rows to bridge delivery, step receipts, delegated action reconciliation, and wrapper state truth.

## DSK boundary notes
- Bridge phase policy should make event delivery timing explicit: same-tick consumer, next-tick persistent event, or direct service call.
- Step transition receipts should emit exactly once on incomplete-to-complete transitions and should not depend on consumers polling state.
- Wrapper state contracts should decide whether puzzle/platformer wrappers own progress state, mirror delegated InteractionTarget state, or declare themselves stateless adapters.
- Bridge/state ownership should start as ProtoKit planning inventory unless core needs reusable DSK fixture helpers for scheduler phase contracts or adapter state ownership reports.

## Open questions
- Should bridge phase policy be a standalone DSK service or a required fixture section for event-handoff and composition-audit proofs?
- Should raw AR placement advance ObjectiveFlow through direct service calls, earlier-phase events, or persisted next-tick bridge events?
- Should ObjectiveFlow and ARExperience step receipts live in one shared step-transition service, or as domain-local fixtures with a common proof row shape?
- Should wrapper kits mutate their own resources after delegated interactions, mirror InteractionTarget completion state, or be renamed/documented as stateless adapters?
- Should bridge-state proof rows wait for public browser proof loading to be fixed, or stay targeted/local until then?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, or `.agent` files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route was fixed.
- No npm publication or deployment was performed.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
