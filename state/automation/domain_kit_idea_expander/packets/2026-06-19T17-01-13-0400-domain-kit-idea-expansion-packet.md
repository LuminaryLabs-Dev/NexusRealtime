# Domain And Kit Idea Expansion Packet: 2026-06-19T17-01-13-0400

## Timestamp
- local: 2026-06-19T17-01-13-0400
- automation: Nexus Realtime: Domain And Kit Idea Expansion

## Lane Goal
- Expand domain and kit idea inventories from evidence and described examples.

## Prior State Context
- Current lane tracker latest root before this run: `domain-kit-idea-root-2026-06-19-1601`.
- Latest current-lane packet added Lifecycle Parity And Cleanup Domain, movement receipt transitions, terrain query/chunk parity, partial-start cleanup, stopped-session state, and lifecycle parity proof rows.
- Latest ecosystem state packet says core remains aligned with latest release branch `0.0.2`, while module-source strategy still blocks ProtoKits fetched-ref proof, Experiments fetched-ref targeted proof, and public browser proof.
- Latest DSK architecture packet orders hardening as base runtime failure-boundary fixtures first, lifecycle parity second, experience-edge third, and public module-source proof separately.
- Latest ecosystem proof packet keeps local available-checkout proof, fetched-ref proof, aggregate proof, targeted DSK proof, browser-complete proof, npm availability, runtime hardening, lifecycle parity, and experience-edge proof as separate claims.
- Latest deep bug packet adds query/command semantics evidence: inactive completed LandmarkGuidance calls still emit transition receipts, EnvironmentalAffordance `nearby()` repeatedly emits entered receipts, missing affordance activation corrupts active state, and RouteField query results expose live mutable marker objects.
- State packets were used for context only. Live docs, source snippets, preflight, and direct file inspection were treated as authority for this run.

## Ideas added
- `docs/domain_ideas.md`
  - Query Command Semantics Domain for terminal receipts, query-versus-transition policy, rejected-command state, query snapshot isolation, and proof rows.
- `docs/kits_ideas.md`
  - `terminal-receipt-policy-kit`
  - `proximity-query-transition-kit`
  - `rejected-command-state-kit`
  - `query-snapshot-isolation-kit`
  - `query-command-semantics-proof-kit`
- `docs/described_examples.md`
  - Query Command Semantics Harness joining terminal receipt, proximity query, rejected command, query isolation, and proof domains.

## Ideas deferred
- Direct fixes for LandmarkGuidance, EnvironmentalAffordance, and RouteField were deferred because this lane cannot edit source or tests.
- A second Spatial Mobility Invariant Domain was not added because this pass focuses on public query and command side effects, not broad spatial transition state.
- A second Receipt Integrity Domain was not added because the evidence mixes receipt idempotency with side-effect-free query and rejected-command state.
- A second Source State Integrity Domain was not added because top-level live query result mutation needs public read-model isolation, not only authored dataset isolation and reset-from-source policy.
- A second Lifecycle Parity And Cleanup Domain was not added because this pass is not about movement, terrain chunk parity, startup cleanup, or stopped sessions.
- Public proof module-source strategy was deferred because it belongs to ecosystem/proof lanes, not this idea lane.
- Executable query/command fixtures were deferred because this lane is planning inventory only.

## Duplicates avoided
- Did not duplicate `transition-state-policy-kit`; `proximity-query-transition-kit` narrows to passive query refreshes versus entered/exited transition producers.
- Did not duplicate `event-idempotency-kit`; `terminal-receipt-policy-kit` focuses on inactive/completed command guards and terminal no-op diagnostics.
- Did not duplicate `command-lifecycle-kit`; `rejected-command-state-kit` focuses on rejected command state preservation and missing-target receipts.
- Did not duplicate `authored-source-isolation-kit`; `query-snapshot-isolation-kit` focuses on public read results and `lastQuery` snapshots rather than caller-owned source config.
- Did not duplicate `lifecycle-parity-proof-kit`; `query-command-semantics-proof-kit` covers read/command semantics for guidance, affordance, and route APIs.

## DSK boundary notes
- These rows are mostly NexusRealtime core validation-surface inventory because the fresh evidence is in existing core public APIs and exported query helpers.
- A future reusable policy layer could still target ProtoKits if implemented as a generic proof kit around query/command semantics, but the current problem is core API hardening coverage.
- Terminal receipt policy should decide whether inactive/completed guidance calls reject, no-op with diagnostics, or emit distinct duplicate/terminal receipts.
- Proximity query policy should separate read-only `nearby`/`nearest` calls from explicit transition-producing updates.
- Rejected command state should keep active ids and `lastEvent` truthful when target ids are missing, inactive, completed, duplicate, or invalid.
- Query snapshot isolation should make route, landmark, affordance, water, and other public read APIs return cloned/immutable snapshots before renderers, telemetry, or proof code can mutate runtime state.

## Open questions
- Should terminal guidance calls return no-op diagnostics, rejected-command receipts, or typed duplicate receipts?
- Should `nearby()` and `nearest()` be strictly side-effect-free, with separate APIs for active target transition updates?
- Should missing affordance activation preserve the previous active target or explicitly clear it with a rejected receipt?
- Should public query snapshots use `structuredClone`, shallow clone with cloned metadata, frozen objects, or serialization-safe snapshot helpers?
- Should the first executable query/command fixture live in core tests, ProtoKits policy tests, or an Experiments proof harness after base DSK hardening starts?

## Not claimed
- No source, tests, package metadata, README, public claims, `memory.md`, or `.agent` files were edited.
- No kit was implemented or promoted.
- No runtime bug was fixed.
- No public proof route or module-source strategy was fixed.
- No ProtoKits or Experiments fetched-ref validation was performed.
- No npm publication or deployment was performed.
- Idea docs remain planning inventory, not release contract or implementation state.
